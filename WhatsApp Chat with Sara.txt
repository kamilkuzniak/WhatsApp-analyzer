4/1/19, 10:31 - Sara: Hey!
I have thought that, because the 2nd of April is Cristina’s birthday (unexpected xD), we can do something and celebrate it. Cris and me are going (probably) to the Low Countries studies lecture and finishes around 20:15-20:30, so we can give her a surprise later. Depending on the people  we are, we can go to my room and eat if we are a few (Kamil and I bought food she likes, that’s not a bad plan😎) or have a walk or something if we are more. Who is joining to do something? Any suggestion? I’m afraid of improvising this kind of things but a birthday is a birthday haha 😊
4/1/19, 10:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you should send that to the group 😅
4/1/19, 10:33 - Sara: I’m sending it individually haha
4/1/19, 10:33 - Sara: Cristina is in every group xD
4/1/19, 10:35 - Sara: it's a surprise :B
4/1/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand , I just woke up and I didn't connect the dots 😂
4/1/19, 10:36 - Sara: Hahaha t's okay <3:)
4/1/19, 18:22 - Sara: Hey polaco, busy tonight? ;)
4/1/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm feeling pretty tired, I think I'm staying at home
4/1/19, 19:42 - Sara: That’s okay :)
4/1/19, 19:43 - Sara: How was your day? 😊
4/1/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty boring
4/1/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hour on bus to Ypres, 3 hours in the company and hour to get back
4/1/19, 19:44 - Sara: Oh! It’s true :D
4/1/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: They showed us some presentations but one guy was talking very quietly and the other had the worst French accent I've ever heard
4/1/19, 19:45 - Sara: Ugh French 😑
4/1/19, 19:45 - Sara: 😂
4/1/19, 19:45 - Sara: So you didn’t understand anything, basicall
4/1/19, 19:45 - Sara: Basically*
4/1/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And later they showed us a bit of their production lines but it was quite noisy and again I didn't understand much 😐
4/1/19, 19:46 - Sara: That’s a shit
4/1/19, 19:46 - Sara: Well, i hope you see the advantages of the trip
4/1/19, 19:46 - Sara: I’m sure you know now more or less what you want to do
4/1/19, 19:46 - Sara: And you went to Ypres
4/1/19, 19:47 - Sara: Ypres is cool hahaha
4/2/19, 13:07 - Sara: Hey people! know it’s soon but I send the message now because I know myself and I can forget hahaha
This evening at 8:15/8:20 in the main entrance of Home Groningen? Cris and I will arrive at that time I think. We are going to be around 10 people, so I have though to go to the common room (or any suggestion?) and eat and talk there until whenever you want. It’s not obligatory to bring food or anything although it’s dinner time, so probably we can have dinner there (or sort of, because bread and carrot are not enough xD). For the ones who are arriving late, send me a message and I answer you in a matter of seconds. It’s not a birthday party or something like that, just a random meeting so don’t feel bad if you arrive late or don’t feel under pressure if you haven’t bought anything. The important thing is to be together (and drink, of course) hahaha See you there ;D
4/2/19, 13:10 - Sara: Well, the main entrance is our entrance xD
4/2/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you coming?

4/2/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet
4/2/19, 20:20 - Sara: Okay
4/2/19, 20:20 - Sara: Hahaha well, it’s not a “surprise” anymore hahaha

5/14/19, 18:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: And behind it a disaster
5/14/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most vile trap
5/14/19, 18:57 - Sara: <Media omitted>
5/14/19, 18:58 - Sara: <Media omitted>
5/14/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel like cooking anything so I wouldn't complain about going for a dinner
5/14/19, 19:06 - Sara: Ummm

5/14/19, 20:42 - Sara: Can it be a little bit later? Not that much but i would appreciate five more minutes 😌
5/14/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: So unprofessional
5/14/19, 20:43 - Sara: Unprofessional is the word? 😂
5/14/19, 21:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ready?
5/14/19, 21:18 - Sara: Sí
5/14/19, 21:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vamos
5/14/19, 23:17 - Sara: <Media omitted>

5/15/19, 18:00 - Sara: Give me some minutes
5/15/19, 18:52 - Sara: Kamil. I have been thinking about what you mentioned me and well, we should talk again
5/15/19, 18:52 - Sara: I mean, after we make up our minds (yeah, me too)
5/15/19, 18:53 - Sara: And decide what we want, i think that’s the fairest
5/15/19, 18:54 - Sara: It’s a thing of the two of us, and I was wrong saying it’s only about you and your feelings (it is something important to take in consideration, but it is not the only parameter)
5/15/19, 18:56 - Sara: We will figure out, i’m sure
5/15/19, 18:57 - Sara: Definitely, having feelings sucks 😂
5/16/19, 13:26 - Sara: Kamil, one question
5/16/19, 13:26 - Sara: From 1 to 10, how dangerous is going to Rabot by bike? 😂
5/16/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on the time of the day, I guess
5/16/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you ask me?
5/16/19, 13:28 - Sara: You told me you went
5/16/19, 13:28 - Sara: Or am I wrong?
5/16/19, 13:29 - Sara: 😂
5/16/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes with a friend who lived there
5/16/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it's particularly dangerous
5/16/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But why would you want to go there?
5/16/19, 13:42 - Sara: A classmate told me to meet there
5/16/19, 13:42 - Sara: Nothing special, but he started telling me that it’s dangerous blablabla
5/16/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I didn't have any problems
5/16/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also I never went there alone
5/16/19, 13:43 - Sara: I’ll see what to do, thanks 😊
5/16/19, 13:43 - Sara: Boy and with company
5/16/19, 13:44 - Sara: Yeah, i’m kind of afraid for that
5/16/19, 13:44 - Sara: Btw, are you better?
5/16/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much the same
5/16/19, 13:46 - Sara: Really?
5/16/19, 13:47 - Sara: Well, if you need something you know where I am
5/16/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what I need
5/16/19, 14:02 - Sara: Sleeping? Beer? Rockets?
5/16/19, 14:03 - Sara: 🚀
5/16/19, 14:03 - Sara: Science is always the answer
5/16/19, 14:04 - Sara: 😁

5/27/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's too much pressure from the environment 😂😂😂
5/27/19, 16:07 - Sara: And then having our first sexual relation 🥰🥰🥰
5/27/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Finally 😋
5/27/19, 16:07 - Sara: My family is happy to know you

5/27/19, 16:09 - Sara: Tell him hi
5/27/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Who is he running from?
5/27/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Old age?
5/27/19, 16:10 - Sara: Life probably
5/27/19, 16:10 - Sara: Maybe he is still afraid with the ghost of Cris’ baby
5/27/19, 16:10 - Sara: Afraid of*
5/27/19, 16:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only thing scarier than Facebook official
5/27/19, 16:11 - Sara: Scarier than your profile photo in Facebook?
5/27/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely
5/27/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: That photo is very useful
5/27/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: It definitely keeps me safe from ever being Facebook official
5/27/19, 16:13 - Sara: Facebook official? 😂
5/27/19, 16:13 - Sara: What do you mean?
5/27/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same as in previous messages, that photo keeps all potential relationships at safe distance 😂
5/27/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although now it seems to be failing
5/27/19, 16:16 - Sara: Do you have a worse photo?
5/27/19, 16:16 - Sara: Maybe that’s the solution
5/27/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Women must have developed immunity
5/27/19, 16:16 - Sara: Not guys? 🌝
5/27/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I should probably look for a new one
5/27/19, 16:17 - Sara: Please please please
5/27/19, 16:17 - Sara: When you were 15
5/27/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was born old, I have no such photos
5/27/19, 16:18 - Sara: I want to send my condolences to your mother, poor her
5/27/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Must have been pretty traumatizing, I do agree
5/27/19, 16:19 - Sara: Oh
5/27/19, 16:19 - Sara: That explains your baby face 👶
5/27/19, 16:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Clearly fake since I've never had one
5/27/19, 16:20 - Sara: I can call Thelma and she does her job
5/27/19, 16:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>

5/27/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a serious note, I'm sorry for Theo
5/27/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure she didn't deserve it
5/27/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nobody does
5/27/19, 16:47 - Sara: Of course not
5/27/19, 16:47 - Sara: But she was quite mature compared to him
5/27/19, 16:48 - Sara: I'm happy she did it, because she was affected
5/27/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🇪🇸<🇬🇷
5/27/19, 16:48 - Sara: Idk, I don't understand why this guy treated her like that
5/27/19, 16:48 - Sara: Definitely

5/27/19, 16:54 - Sara: 😌
5/27/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: They seem kind of nice
5/27/19, 16:54 - Sara: or Polish guys
5/27/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not so sure about that, but ok
5/27/19, 16:55 - Sara: why not?

5/27/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure I already told you that
5/27/19, 16:59 - Sara: oh true
5/27/19, 16:59 - Sara: Yep
5/27/19, 16:59 - Sara: it's funny because I thought about the conversation about yerterday xD
5/27/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: About the chicken?
5/27/19, 17:00 - Sara: About the chicken and about boys
5/27/19, 17:00 - Sara: I prefer thinking only about Theo's chicken
5/27/19, 17:00 - Sara: ☺
5/27/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well jaja can also mean balls in polish
5/27/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's appropriate
5/27/19, 17:01 - Sara: I reget crying for him today x)

5/27/19, 17:03 - Sara: Kamil
5/27/19, 17:04 - Sara: Can we throw tomatoes together?
5/27/19, 17:04 - Sara: I'm in that mood
5/27/19, 17:04 - Sara: ☺
5/27/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a little bit far but ok, I want to visit Spain
5/27/19, 17:05 - Sara: Or in general 😂
5/27/19, 17:06 - Sara: Throwing tomatoes in general
5/27/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I would like to have a specific target
5/27/19, 17:06 - Sara: Natalia's window is also finde
5/27/19, 17:06 - Sara: fine
5/27/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just what I was going to propose 🤔
5/27/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Great minds think alike
5/27/19, 17:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: For that I think we can probably find many volunteers
5/27/19, 17:08 - Sara: **find 36568297 volunteers**
5/27/19, 17:08 - Sara: hahahaha
5/27/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Interesting, in Flanders two right wing parties that want to separate Flanders from Belgium won the elections
5/27/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't suspect Belgians to be nationalist but ok
5/27/19, 19:02 - Sara: Is it possible for two parties to win?
5/27/19, 19:02 - Sara: We were talking about that yesterday haha
5/27/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean two parties with highest amount of votes
5/27/19, 19:02 - Sara: <Media omitted>
5/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: Ah okay okay
5/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: It’s quite weird and alarming
5/27/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: but in the south and in Brussels the greens won
5/27/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: so it's definitely going to be difficult for them to form any sort of central government
5/27/19, 19:05 - Sara: But the votes are for the whole country or for french/dutch/german place?
5/27/19, 19:06 - Sara: I’m reading that the first one is conservative, but are opposed to the second
5/27/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: obviously somebody needs to form a coalition but fortunately the two right wing parties don't have enough votes to have a majority even if they do
5/27/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: left is obviously not going to talk with them
5/27/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: and centrists apparently also don't like them
5/27/19, 19:08 - Sara: They’ll have to be together
5/27/19, 19:08 - Sara: Btw, who are the greens?
5/27/19, 19:08 - Sara: I mean, literally the ecological party?
5/27/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecolo
5/27/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: it seems so 😁
5/27/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: perfect for you 💪
5/27/19, 19:09 - Sara: Maybe they have enough to be together
5/27/19, 19:09 - Sara: 🥦
5/27/19, 19:10 - Sara: Btw, you changed the facebook profile. I’m sad :/
5/27/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, yes

6/2/19, 16:24 - Sara: Always complaining
6/2/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm dying, how am I supposed to study effectively
6/2/19, 16:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/2/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, I was looking at flights and it seems to be quite difficult to get from Warsaw to Madrid
6/2/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But there are flights to Barcelona
6/2/19, 16:26 - Sara: Weird
6/2/19, 16:26 - Sara: Do you suggest going there?
6/2/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I was taking a break and I just took a look
6/2/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: No plans yet
6/2/19, 16:27 - Sara: Ok
6/2/19, 16:27 - Sara: Now i’m curious
6/2/19, 16:28 - Sara: I don’t have neither direct flights to varsow
6/2/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess I need to relocate to some other place
6/2/19, 16:30 - Sara: Recolocate?
6/2/19, 16:30 - Sara: Relocate*?
6/2/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I mentioned that I don't want to stay in Poland
6/2/19, 16:32 - Sara: Ummmm
6/2/19, 16:32 - Sara: Now with more reason 😂
6/2/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: The problem is I have no clue where to
6/2/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤔
6/2/19, 16:37 - Sara: Where makes you happy ☺
6/2/19, 16:47 - Sara: Any place in mind?
6/2/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not France
6/2/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a start I suppose 😂
6/2/19, 16:51 - Sara: Are you sure?
6/2/19, 16:52 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/2/19, 16:52 - Sara: With their beautiful buildings and easy language
6/2/19, 16:52 - Sara: And their cheap food
6/2/19, 16:52 - Sara: And their fire 🥰🥰
6/2/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/2/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: It already burned so nothing else to do there
6/2/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a serious note, I guess first I'll take a look at internship and work offers and I'll try to pick something based on that
6/2/19, 16:55 - Sara: Great
6/2/19, 16:56 - Sara: Internship in your uni?
6/2/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll ask there first, if there won't be anything interesting I'll try to look somewhere else
6/2/19, 16:58 - Sara: Cool 😎
6/2/19, 16:59 - Sara: You will tell me but again, don’t depend on me or us. The important thing is that convinces you 😎
6/2/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spain is certainly a possibility, but I'm kind of afraid of melting
6/2/19, 17:20 - Sara: Hahahha
6/2/19, 17:20 - Sara: Would you know enough Spanish?
6/2/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still have a few months before I can go anywhere
6/2/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: And if I went there I would probably improve quite quickly
6/2/19, 17:21 - Sara: I can teach you 🐒
6/2/19, 17:21 - Sara: Yeah, of course
6/2/19, 17:22 - Sara: When will you know the places?
6/2/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll start looking after I return to Poland
6/2/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, maybe august or september
6/2/19, 17:23 - Sara: Cool cool, yeah
6/2/19, 17:23 - Sara: You are not in a rush
6/2/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but that was more or less the plan anyway
6/2/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Regardless of new developments 😊
6/2/19, 17:25 - Sara: Developments of 9 months 😊
6/2/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: more like last 4 months  😋
6/2/19, 17:27 - Sara: 👶

6/2/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: The one he stepped on? 😂
6/2/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it was all part of the plan, I see...
6/2/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👌
6/2/19, 17:47 - Sara: Plan to destroy the world?
6/2/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: If someone asks, I don't know anything
6/2/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't have to kill me
6/2/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please

6/3/19, 00:03 - Sara: So you know
6/3/19, 00:03 - Sara: Nalguitas > vodka
6/3/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: What a nonsense 😐
6/3/19, 00:04 - Sara: Vodka in nalguitas is better?
6/3/19, 00:05 - Sara: But only buttocks are good enough

6/3/19, 22:19 - Sara: I think so
6/3/19, 22:19 - Sara: But idk, i feel a little bit dismotivated
6/3/19, 22:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
6/3/19, 22:19 - Sara: Thinking about the other exam
6/3/19, 22:20 - Sara: Idk, maybe I won’t perform well neither
6/3/19, 22:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't think like that
6/3/19, 22:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: It never helped anybody
6/3/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: One exam is not the end of the world
6/3/19, 22:21 - Sara: Well
6/3/19, 22:21 - Sara: It’s true
6/3/19, 22:21 - Sara: Yeah, i know but uff
6/3/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you don't even know the results
6/3/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last semester I was pretty sure I failed two exams
6/3/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then I got the results and it turned out that I passed them
6/3/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: So no reason to worry about it now
6/3/19, 22:22 - Sara: That’s you 😂
6/3/19, 22:22 - Sara: But yeah, I agre
6/3/19, 22:22 - Sara: Agree
6/3/19, 22:23 - Sara: Maybe i don’t like the idea of changing my summer plans
6/3/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, it's done now and worrying about it is not going to change anything
6/3/19, 22:24 - Sara: That’s also truth but ugh, I feel stupid 😂
6/3/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, acknowledging that we don't know something is actually a sign of being intelligent 🤔
6/3/19, 22:25 - Sara: Hahaha  who said that? 😂
6/3/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/3/19, 22:26 - Sara: Philosophical mood 😆
6/3/19, 22:26 - Sara: Yeah, that’s the only thing we can know
6/3/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, to summarize:
1. You're not stupid
2. You are going to smash that exam 😊
6/3/19, 22:29 - Sara: I hope :,)

6/3/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at least weather was quite good for that today
6/3/19, 22:30 - Sara: Was it that bad?
6/3/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yesterday, yes
6/3/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, if I even had a headache, something was seriously wrong
6/3/19, 22:32 - Sara: Is there something wrong?
6/3/19, 22:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, today was colder and everything was perfectly fine
6/3/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: By wrong, I mean Spanish sun in Belgium
6/3/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you to take it back, but you said no
6/3/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: So inconsiderate 😂
6/3/19, 22:33 - Sara: That’s not Spanish 😂 at least not in summer
6/3/19, 22:33 - Sara: Maybe on thursday
6/3/19, 22:34 - Sara: I’m evil, you know
6/3/19, 22:39 - Sara: So you have been only studying?

6/3/19, 23:24 - Sara: Truuuuuuue
6/3/19, 23:24 - Sara: I forgot
6/3/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I think I've already rewatched almost all the episodes anyway 😂
6/3/19, 23:25 - Sara: Hahaha fair enough
6/3/19, 23:25 - Sara: I’m remembering the episode when Summer is stuck in that ufo/car 😂
6/4/19, 00:00 - Sara: Well, i’m going to sleep. Tomorrow I will wake up early to revise

6/4/19, 11:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>

6/4/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: As you know I am not circumside, I have foreskin
6/4/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: When you do oral you sort of pulled it back
6/4/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: And in that case some sort of lubrication is necessary
6/4/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if you don't pull it back, than not really
6/4/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it also doesn't really feel like much then
6/4/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Does this answer your question? 😂
6/4/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: *circumsised
6/4/19, 23:37 - Sara: Really...? Oooomg i didn’t noticeeed
6/4/19, 23:38 - Sara: So if it lubricated, the better

6/4/19, 23:44 - Sara: I found a youtube video 🥰
6/4/19, 23:44 - Sara: They recommend oil for massage
6/4/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: So bad, I think you should ask a priest
6/4/19, 23:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/4/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Instead delving into this immoral pond of depravity called youtube
6/4/19, 23:46 - Sara: Amazing video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOfzECf2aO8 It has spanish subtitules, it's a sign

6/4/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, I haven't reached part of the Spanish course about sexual vocabulary so they won't be much help anyway 🤣
6/4/19, 23:48 - Sara: I have just found another video about postures **writing**
6/4/19, 23:49 - Sara: As well
6/4/19, 23:50 - Sara: You should be proud of my knowledge in sex
6/4/19, 23:50 - Sara: At least i won’t fail

6/5/19, 11:00 - Sara: Always
6/5/19, 11:00 - Sara: Your food is quite good and I have to insult you to feel better
6/5/19, 11:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I can understand that, after all you just copy French omelette, change the name and call it your own
6/5/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I pity you
6/5/19, 11:02 - Sara: Please, learn Spanish history 😂

6/5/19, 11:20 - Sara: That’s a challenge?
6/5/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's a fact
6/5/19, 11:21 - Sara: If you help me cook maybe I can cook something decent
6/5/19, 11:21 - Sara: But idk what it is better
6/5/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll think about it 🤔
6/5/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then again, I don't think that my help has ever made anybody cook better 😋
6/5/19, 11:23 - Sara: Because you are a horrible cook :)

6/5/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Never heard about polish whiskey 🥃
6/5/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless you call vodka polish whiskey
6/5/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this is similar to Tortilla being Spanish omelette 😂
6/5/19, 18:14 - Sara: You only have vodka and it’s more famous the russian one... losers
6/5/19, 18:14 - Sara: What do you mean?

6/5/19, 23:23 - Sara: And that's the assignment
6/5/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: invited readers only
6/5/19, 23:24 - Sara: Oh, okay. No problem. If you understand the assignment, you will visualise it :P
6/5/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would prefer not to visualize 🤣🤣🤣
6/5/19, 23:25 - Sara: why? :(
6/5/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: what exactly do you want me to look into?
6/5/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: merithorically, stylisticlly, gramatically?
6/5/19, 23:27 - Sara: To read it in general, if you get the whole idea, if the text follows a theme line...
6/5/19, 23:27 - Sara: I'm in the mood of ''I have been completan it all day and now my mind is tired of it'' xD
6/5/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, I'll try but no promises that it will be of any use 😋
6/5/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: it looks like it's not about transistors so it might be hard
6/5/19, 23:29 - Sara: Thanks ❤ I want it to be a text that even an engineer...I mean idiot can understand it
6/5/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/5/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: what?
6/5/19, 23:40 - Sara: The photo 😂
6/5/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I showed you this photo
6/5/19, 23:41 - Sara: No, the profile one. You changed it 😂
6/5/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/5/19, 23:42 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂😂
6/5/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: the technological perspective attempts to encounter this ‘second phenomenon’ and its connotation with the aid of programs specialized metaphor identification.
6/5/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: are you sure that "encounter" is the word that you wanted to use here?
6/5/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe I'm missunderstanding the meaning
6/5/19, 23:45 - Sara: Mmmm it’s about finding it
6/5/19, 23:46 - Sara: Discover, detect, find can be better
6/5/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so, I don't think that encounter is synonymous with these
6/5/19, 23:47 - Sara: 👌🏻
6/5/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: encoding is “the technique used by gay and lesbians writers to subtly incorporate homosexual themes into their work,
6/5/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: also here I think it should be lesbian
6/5/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: instead of lesbians
6/5/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: small thing but I suppose in your field it matters
6/5/19, 23:48 - Sara: That’s a direct quiotation but maybe i wrote it wrongly
6/5/19, 23:48 - Sara: Yeah, or both plural or both singular. I’ll check it
6/5/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: but here you have writers
6/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: Oh, says writers 😂
6/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: I didn’t read it
6/5/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: so lesbian and gay is not a noun
6/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: True 😂 my mind is friend omg
6/5/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: the digital literary study motion
6/5/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: what is this
6/5/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
6/5/19, 23:50 - Sara: Notion 😂
6/5/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: ah, ok
6/5/19, 23:51 - Sara: Perfective, idea
6/5/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought it was some sort of movement
6/5/19, 23:51 - Sara: Digital literary studies is a literary field 😁
6/5/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant movement like human rights movement or something like that
6/5/19, 23:52 - Sara: Nop
6/5/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok
6/5/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: do you want me to point out grammatical mistakes or don't bother?
6/5/19, 23:53 - Sara: Yes please
6/5/19, 23:53 - Sara: I have checked it a lot, but uf
6/5/19, 23:53 - Sara: Maybe some of them were subtle ♥
6/5/19, 23:53 - Sara: 😂*
6/5/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is posisble to say that using softwares to automatically identify metaphors
6/5/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: *possible
6/5/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: also you cannot write "softwares"
6/5/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: it;s uncountable
6/5/19, 23:55 - Sara: Software programs?
6/5/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
6/5/19, 23:55 - Sara: Are they synonyms?
6/5/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, I would just right software
6/5/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: *write
6/5/19, 23:56 - Sara: 👌🏻
6/5/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the beginning,  Topic Modeling was an option to deal with this project, but it is not as precise as other approaches such as Word Sense Disambiguation
6/5/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think maybe "In the beggining" might be better in that context
6/5/19, 23:59 - Sara: Okay
6/6/19, 00:00 - Sara: Initially maybe it’s better
6/6/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the beginning means in general, whole time I think
6/6/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: and at the beginning is more about a specific time
6/6/19, 00:01 - Sara: Mmmmm
6/6/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: but initially also seems good
6/6/19, 00:01 - Sara: Maybe one is about spatial place and the other is more metaphorical
6/6/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/20389/at-the-beginning-or-in-the-beginning
6/6/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: when in doubt, google it
6/6/19, 00:02 - Sara: Yep, that’s what I normally do
6/6/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: In addition, it will be always crucial the extra support of a literary scholar and his/her background and common knowledge about the analyzed material and its context.
6/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: I didn’t think about in the beginning🤔
6/6/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: this sentence looks kind of bad
6/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: Kind of bad 😂
6/6/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: In addition, the extra support of a literary scholar and his/her background and common knowledge about the analyzed material and its context will always be crucial.
6/6/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think like this it sounds better
6/6/19, 00:04 - Sara: Yeah
6/6/19, 00:04 - Sara: Fuck Spanishing English 😂
6/6/19, 00:05 - Sara: We can switch it, but it’s true that in English is not that common or formal
6/6/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: This researcher would be able to check and provide additional examination of the identified metaphors by the program.
6/6/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: metaphors identified by the program
6/6/19, 00:07 - Sara: 🤦🏽‍♀
6/6/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: As a whole, this project was needed to be embodied for two peculiar reasons; one is for linguistic and literary purposes, and the other one is more related to the socio-cultural perspective that this topic displays.
6/6/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: is embodied really the word to use here?
6/6/19, 00:07 - Sara: Mmmm
6/6/19, 00:07 - Sara: Illustrated?
6/6/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe implemented or something like that?
6/6/19, 00:08 - Sara: From an abstract idea to a “physical” one
6/6/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's implementation
6/6/19, 00:08 - Sara: Okay
6/6/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: also this : instead of that ;
6/6/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think, unless you wanted to do something different
6/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: Mmm this issue is more complex
6/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: But maybe for avoiding problems is better
6/6/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: i'm not sure, your choice
6/6/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Decoding Homoerotic Poetry in Dickinson, Whitman and Lorde is not only a website that supports and encourage the decodification of metaphors in poetru, but also it is a point where diverse literary researchers can meet each other for investigation motives in respect to Audre, Whitman, Dickinson or metaphors and figures of speech.
6/6/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: encourages
6/6/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: poetry
6/6/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: meet each other to investigate
6/6/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: or maybe for investigation of
6/6/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: also with respect to
6/6/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think
6/6/19, 00:13 - Sara: Both are correct
6/6/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/with-respect-to-in-respect-of
6/6/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: "in respect of" it seems
6/6/19, 00:14 - Sara: You use with respect to to say what something relates to. In British English, you can also say in respect of.
6/6/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, but you wrote in respect to
6/6/19, 00:14 - Sara: Omg
6/6/19, 00:14 - Sara: 😂😂🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀
6/6/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: the outlook that this blog has taken regards homosexuality and, by and large, queer studies is by considering it as a cultural source that makes visible and normalizes LGBT people via online
6/6/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it should be in regards to
6/6/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: sorry in regard to
6/6/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: also I don't like the end of that sentence
6/6/19, 00:18 - Sara: Take regard of, yes
6/6/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: that makes visible and normalizes LGBT people via online.
6/6/19, 00:18 - Sara: Mmmmm
6/6/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe highlight instead of makes visible
6/6/19, 00:19 - Sara: I don’t know if that’s the connotation
6/6/19, 00:19 - Sara: Wait
6/6/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: also this "via online" seems weird
6/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: What I want to say is that this ideas, this kind of people has been hidden
6/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: And not now, you know?
6/6/19, 00:21 - Sara: Yep, i thought it
6/6/19, 00:21 - Sara: Metaphorically, of course
6/6/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know what you mean, I had a word in polish in mind and google translated it to highlight
6/6/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: which is not a great translation
6/6/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe "makes lgbt people visible and normalizes them online"
6/6/19, 00:24 - Sara: yep
6/6/19, 00:24 - Sara: sounds better
6/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: oh
6/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: i'm talking with my sister C:
6/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: sooorry
6/6/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your loss, I'm wearing my glasses
6/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: NOOOOO
6/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: 🤓

6/6/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: *appears
6/6/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: As a matter of fact, the administrators also have supplied a brief biography of the real writers for both make the blog more credible and for slightly complement the posts.

6/6/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure about set apart here
6/6/19, 00:33 - Sara: put aside?
6/6/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: The glossary part was created to explain in a straightforward manner the expressions that can be difficult to interpret
6/6/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe something like this?
6/6/19, 00:35 - Sara: yes
6/6/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, set apart for me means something different
6/6/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Graf's natural athleticism set her apart from other tennis players.
6/6/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: example
6/6/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: being able to access by hyperlinks.

6/6/19, 00:37 - Sara: yep
6/6/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: What it is more, this word index is  subdivided as well in three segments for each author having one on their own

6/7/19, 11:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm assuming that it went well 💪
6/7/19, 11:46 - Sara: Not bad 😬
6/7/19, 11:48 - Sara: How is it going for you?

6/7/19, 11:49 - Sara: Ser you in the evening 😎
6/7/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me when you return from lunch, I think there are still a few small things to improve in the assignment
6/7/19, 11:58 - Sara: Okaaay
6/7/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/7/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've had 4 and all of them ran out
6/7/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And they are sort of useful
6/7/19, 12:29 - Sara: Nop :(
6/7/19, 12:30 - Sara: Okay!
6/7/19, 12:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, no problem 😋
6/7/19, 12:33 - Sara: That means that you are going to come? 😬
6/7/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I'll just tell you what I think could still be improved
6/7/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll come in the evening
6/7/19, 12:34 - Sara: Tell me by messages then
6/7/19, 12:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, that was the plan
6/7/19, 13:19 - Sara: I’m available now 😎
6/7/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is in the shape of a blog in blogspot.com.
6/7/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: it seems that technically it is correct
6/7/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: but typically we use on for websites instead of in
6/7/19, 13:29 - Sara: Good to know! Merci :3
6/7/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: the outlook that this blog has taken regards of homosexuality and, by and large
6/7/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: there I think should be in regards to
6/7/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mentioned it yesterday
6/7/19, 13:30 - Sara: Yep, i forgot that one
6/7/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: the Glossary part was created to explain in a straightforward manner the expressions that can be difficult to interpret, and it is access by hyperlinks.
6/7/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: also this
6/7/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe accessible?
6/7/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: or accessed
6/7/19, 13:31 - Sara: Or accessed
6/7/19, 13:31 - Sara: Yep, i thought in that one but i’ll see which one use
6/7/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, this division has been accomplished for the easy navigation of the website.
6/7/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, this division has been implemented to make navigation of the website easier.
6/7/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, getting closer to the unessay project and the indivividual assessment,
6/7/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure about this getting closer
6/7/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe focusing on the unessay?
6/7/19, 13:33 - Sara: Mmmm
6/7/19, 13:33 - Sara: I don’t want to repeat focus
6/7/19, 13:33 - Sara: Highlight maybe
6/7/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I felt lost in the first days due to the fact that Aida and Matthias had similar ideas and contrasted with mine.
6/7/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I understand this sentence
6/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: Mmmm
6/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: Wait
6/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: I’ll try to paraphrase it
6/7/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Furthermore, when it comes to the different developing of this unessay,
6/7/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: also this part sounds a bit strange
6/7/19, 13:42 - Sara: Anything else? 😁
6/7/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: nop, I read it quite carefully yesterday
6/7/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: so there wasn't much left
6/7/19, 13:43 - Sara: Thanks a lot ♥
6/7/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Be me
Be 26
Recently got married to a solid 7/10
She wants kids right away
Gets her wish
Fast forward 9 months
Baby is on the way
In the waiting room becouse i couldn’t handle it
Wife has baby
mfw i see my child for the first time
Told her she could name tge baby anything she wanted
She tells the doctor that her name is Love
Wife isn’t a hippy or anything
I’m not huge fan, but fuck it, i promised her
Fast forward 10 years
Baby is growing up
Love comes back from school crying
Ask what’s wrong
Says she is being bullied becouse of her name
I cheer her up with some ice cream
Problem solved and bast dad award achived
Fast Forward 7 more years
Love has turned into a 9/10
She dresses normal
Always wears red nail polish
But she is shy
Very shy
She is still mocked constantly becouse of her not so ordinary name
She comes home from school
Obviously disturbed
Ask her if its about her name
She says nothing
Just kisses me on the cheek and leaves
First time she has kissed me since she was baby
Just wasn’t her thing
Can hear wife pulling in
She is home early from work
Hear door open from daughters room
Door then opens from garage
Loud blast goes off directly behind me
I fall to the ground
Wife looks at me and screams
I look down and see bullet through me chest
Love says something about her name
I look up at my still beautiful wife
I say
Shot through the heart
And you’re to blame
You give Love
A bad name
6/7/19, 13:44 - Sara: What is that? 😂
6/7/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: just read

6/8/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: It makes people reach old age 🤔
6/8/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Instead of dying during childhood
6/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: We should be anti-vax
6/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: What are we waiting for

6/8/19, 17:11 - Sara: That’s another advantage 😛
6/8/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I would also have to clean my new ass in addition to my old ass
6/8/19, 17:12 - Sara: New ass 😂
6/8/19, 17:12 - Sara: Changing from asspain to chinass

6/9/19, 11:54 - Sara: Well, the audio is only in polish so i don’t have another choice haha
6/9/19, 11:54 - Sara: But yeah, i thought about that
6/9/19, 11:54 - Sara: I thought it was for something concrete 😂
6/9/19, 11:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, in general I just think that watching things in original language is better
6/9/19, 11:55 - Sara: Totally agree
6/9/19, 11:56 - Sara: The real essence is there ☺
6/9/19, 11:58 - Sara: So better for you if we watch it together 😜

6/9/19, 17:29 - Sara: Together
6/9/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it doesn't really matter when we go
6/9/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: At that moment university will be closed
6/9/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I'll be just doing a whole lotta nothing
6/9/19, 17:31 - Sara: Okaay

6/9/19, 23:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/10/19, 00:07 - Sara: Okay, I have something in mind abut the travel (yeah, you know me. I'm that organized). at least I'm not that stressed and worried C:
6/10/19, 00:09 - Sara: I have thought something about 19-20 of july until the 24-25th july (yeah, i think the biggest parties in the summer festival will be from the 25th, which is thursday)
6/10/19, 00:09 - Sara: Prague and Vienna mainly, but I can find something else
6/10/19, 00:10 - Sara: Having in mind direct flights for both of us (probably I will go somewhere else before with my sis)
6/10/19, 00:11 - Sara: I have also seen Vilna, but maybe is more comple
6/10/19, 00:11 - Sara: complex*
6/10/19, 00:12 - Sara: My combinations would be these ones: Vienna-Prague // Berlin- Vienna // Berlin-Vilna? // Prague-Vienna
6/10/19, 00:12 - Sara: If you have any preference, tell me :P
6/10/19, 00:13 - Sara: Maybe I can move the dates, depending if you prever being more in Ghent ^^
6/10/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would like to go to Prague, about the rest, I will think
6/10/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm going to sleep, I'll tell you later
6/10/19, 00:14 - Sara: okaaay
6/10/19, 00:14 - Sara: Buenas noches 😘
6/10/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
6/10/19, 00:31 - Sara: And yeah, I forgot to say. You’re always welcome to come to Spain but we can talk about that in July \(^0^)/
6/10/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: How's it going, Sara erasmus?
6/10/19, 13:46 - Sara: Sara Erasmus 😱
6/10/19, 13:47 - Sara: Well, I’m better but my day started being sad
6/10/19, 13:47 - Sara: What about you impaled Polish?
6/10/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much the same as yesterday, the day before, and the day before that as well 😂
6/10/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's nice of you to ask 😘
6/10/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why were you sad?
6/10/19, 13:48 - Sara: 💋
6/10/19, 13:48 - Sara: The same as always, nothing new
6/10/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Think about the other way, soon you will have a satisfyer 😘
6/10/19, 13:53 - Sara: I wish masturbation could solve everything 😂
6/10/19, 13:53 - Sara: But yeah, it’s like being unconcious haha
6/10/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Better than drinking, I guess 🍻
6/10/19, 13:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/10/19, 13:54 - Sara: Definitelly
6/10/19, 13:54 - Sara: Cheaper maybe 😂
6/10/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/10/19, 13:55 - Sara: At the same time? Mmmm
6/10/19, 13:55 - Sara: Not a bad plan
6/10/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you have two hands
6/10/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you should be able to manage easily
6/10/19, 13:56 - Sara: My mouth will be open so yeah, i can do both 😂
6/10/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Satisfying on both ends
6/10/19, 13:57 - Sara: Yes 😂
6/10/19, 13:57 - Sara: I wish i had it here 😂
6/10/19, 13:58 - Sara: But now, talking more seriously, i really suffer when i don’t feel good and i cannot tell it. Maybe I have to learn to manage it by myself.
6/10/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: But why you cannot tell it?
6/10/19, 13:59 - Sara: People are busy 😂 and me also
6/10/19, 14:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, sadly true
6/10/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: After Wednesday morning, I can listen as long as you need
6/10/19, 14:01 - Sara: 😂
6/10/19, 14:01 - Sara: I don’t annoy you then
6/10/19, 14:01 - Sara: Keep studying 😌
6/10/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're not annoying and I texted you first 😊
6/10/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was taking a break
6/10/19, 14:02 - Sara: Ah okay
6/10/19, 14:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: If anything, I am annoying you right now 😘
6/10/19, 14:03 - Sara: Nah, you never annoy don’t worry
6/10/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Never?
6/10/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Damn it, I have to try harder
6/10/19, 14:04 - Sara: 😂
6/10/19, 14:05 - Sara: People I care never annoy me
6/10/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's not fair
6/10/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That means that I never stood a chance
6/10/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: The game was rigged from the start
6/10/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
6/10/19, 14:06 - Sara: A chance for what? 😜
6/10/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Being annoying of course
6/10/19, 14:06 - Sara: You can try 😂
6/10/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's my goal in life, haven't you noticed?
6/10/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you haven't that means that it's worse than I suspected
6/10/19, 14:07 - Sara: From time to time
6/10/19, 14:09 - Sara: You have to put more effort
6/10/19, 14:10 - Sara: I haven’t asked you, are you okay?
6/10/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I was careful with my bike and now I'm doing perfectly neutral
6/10/19, 14:11 - Sara: You arrived home safe 😂
6/10/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, ok back to studying
6/10/19, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll annoy you later
6/10/19, 14:14 - Sara: Okay
6/10/19, 14:14 - Sara: Wait
6/10/19, 14:14 - Sara: Why after?
6/10/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: after the exam
6/10/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can listen a bit right now, but after the exam you can have my full attention
6/10/19, 14:16 - Sara: Not now, it was just a mere question 😁
6/10/19, 14:16 - Sara: Go hard with your study 👏🏽♥
6/10/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, I wonder who is using Andraz's number
6/10/19, 16:15 - Sara: Yeah
6/10/19, 16:15 - Sara: Man, I thought he was messing up with us and me
6/10/19, 16:15 - Sara: 😂😂😂
6/10/19, 16:15 - Sara: I’ll ask him
6/10/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought so as well, but then I realized
6/10/19, 16:15 - Sara: By facebook
6/10/19, 16:16 - Sara: How is it going?
6/10/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, I had a few small issues with the project but I manged to solve them
6/10/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now just doing simulations and tweaking the parameters
6/10/19, 16:17 - Sara: Cool 😜
6/10/19, 16:19 - Sara: Life wants me to fail my exams and have emotional inestability, what’s wrong with me 😂
6/10/19, 16:19 - Sara: My ex is talking to me and well, it’s hard to manage
6/10/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for you 😢
6/10/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You wanted to kind of normalize situation with him, no?
6/10/19, 16:26 - Sara: I suppose
6/10/19, 16:26 - Sara: A lot of feelings at the same time
6/10/19, 16:27 - Sara: Thanks...
6/10/19, 16:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can help somehow, tell me 😔
6/10/19, 16:31 - Sara: Idk if i’m honest
6/10/19, 18:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/10/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can talk whenever you want, no problem ❤️
6/10/19, 18:16 - Sara: Yor exam is your exam, don’t worry 😬
6/10/19, 21:17 - Sara: I’m sure you do this https://twitter.com/satisfyingdaily/status/1134670958537662464?s=21
6/10/19, 22:22 - Sara: Hey, what’s up? Busy right?
6/10/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: What's on your mind?
6/10/19, 22:23 - Sara: Nothing special, knowing about you 😂
6/10/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tired, something is wrong with my simulation and I don't know how to solve it
6/10/19, 22:24 - Sara: Ask your mates
6/10/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I will go to uni tomorrow in the morning and ask the assistant
6/10/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already asked but they don't know
6/10/19, 22:25 - Sara: Is that complex? Or what is it about?
6/10/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just some weird error
6/10/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I solve it, it's almost finished
6/10/19, 22:26 - Sara: Check it again, maybe it’s so tiny that you didn’t notice
6/10/19, 22:26 - Sara: As my digital literature studies essay 😂
6/10/19, 22:26 - Sara: Great! 😁👌🏻
6/10/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm here
6/10/19, 23:48 - Sara: Okaay
6/11/19, 09:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, my friend wasn't replying because he was in a hospital 😐
6/11/19, 09:36 - Sara: :/
6/11/19, 09:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it was probably another attempt on his life by American government
6/11/19, 09:36 - Sara: Yeah, FBI is looking for him
6/11/19, 09:36 - Sara: So how is it going?
6/11/19, 09:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: He gave me his password, I'm checking his project right now, I'll compare
6/11/19, 09:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll see something I missed
6/11/19, 09:37 - Sara: You didn’t solve it in uni?
6/11/19, 09:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also found the assistant but he has a meeting right now
6/11/19, 09:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: So in the meantime I'm trying on my own
6/11/19, 09:38 - Sara: Okay, go for it 🤗🤗🤗
6/11/19, 10:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/11/19, 10:05 - Sara: 😂😂😂
6/11/19, 10:05 - Sara: Accurate
6/11/19, 10:05 - Sara: And that photo is with me 😁
6/11/19, 10:06 - Sara: So if I appear, it’s a good photo 😌
6/11/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: IT WORKS
6/11/19, 10:20 - Sara: YAY 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
6/11/19, 10:21 - Sara: So is if finished? 🤗🤗♥♥
6/11/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not entirely, but now I can actually do something with it
6/11/19, 10:22 - Sara: That’s cool! Congratulations 😁😁☺☺
6/11/19, 10:22 - Sara: Did you do it on your own? Will you need your assistant’s help?
6/11/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a different question for him anyway, but that I managed on my own
6/11/19, 10:23 - Sara: Cool 🥰
6/11/19, 10:23 - Sara: So you are still there right?
6/11/19, 10:23 - Sara: That’s quite perfect 😄
6/11/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: The program I am using works much faster here
6/11/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I can work a lot faster
6/11/19, 10:24 - Sara: Good, take advantage of that 😬
6/11/19, 10:24 - Sara: Good luck 😚
6/11/19, 11:22 - Sara: Btw, random thought. I don’t know if you have watched Bojack Horseman but I think you would like it
6/11/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
6/11/19, 13:15 - Sara: Maybe it’s a sign 😌❤
6/11/19, 16:58 - Sara: https://twitter.com/xvndrita/status/1137705841442861056?s=08
6/11/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It says to send it without context
6/11/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I kind of know it 😊
6/11/19, 19:42 - Sara: Just a reminder 😜
6/11/19, 19:43 - Sara: How is the study going?
6/11/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still trying to finish the project
6/11/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was wrong
6/11/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was far from ovet
6/11/19, 19:43 - Sara: 😕
6/11/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: *over
6/11/19, 19:43 - Sara: What happened?
6/11/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it simply doesn't work properly
6/11/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I noticed that I made a small mistake now and after correcting it it looks a bit better
6/11/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But still not quite there
6/11/19, 19:44 - Sara: Keep the faith 🥰
6/11/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I'm not sleeping again 😂
6/11/19, 19:45 - Sara: Don’t say that
6/11/19, 19:45 - Sara: I’m sure you can finish it on time
6/11/19, 19:45 - Sara: And if not, i can let you my bed after the exam 😌
6/11/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe but I also want to revise a bit more
6/11/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will probably cry there, but it's been wet many times already so one more time makes little difference
6/11/19, 19:47 - Sara: Yeah, it’s a water matress now
6/11/19, 19:47 - Sara: But i’m sure you won’t cry 😄
6/11/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably not
6/11/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just sad
6/11/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Without tears
6/11/19, 19:48 - Sara: You’ll be happy because you’ll do the best exam in the world 👏🏽💕
6/11/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exam itself, maybe
6/11/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Project, not so much
6/11/19, 19:49 - Sara: How are the percentages?
6/11/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exam 12 points, project 8, I think
6/11/19, 19:50 - Sara: So even if the project is worse, you can pass
6/11/19, 19:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes but I would have to do really well on the exam
6/11/19, 19:51 - Sara: Mmmm well, think in positive
6/11/19, 19:51 - Sara: Again, you have time
6/11/19, 19:52 - Sara: Never say never 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
6/11/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not giving up yet
6/11/19, 19:52 - Sara: You shouldn’t 😌
6/11/19, 19:53 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/11/19, 22:09 - Sara: Going late and being the first one 😂😭
6/12/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is having a life going? 😘
6/12/19, 01:09 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/12/19, 01:09 - Sara: It’s good! Probably coming bck now
6/12/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
6/12/19, 01:09 - Sara: What about you?
6/12/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: After failing miserably to make my circuit work I changed my strategy
6/12/19, 01:10 - Sara: Tell me
6/12/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am using my friends circuit, which is almost the same but works
6/12/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I applied my equations to it
6/12/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's basically almost the same as I had before, but works
6/12/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I have no clue why it didn't before 😐
6/12/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bottom line is that now I have results to show to professor
6/12/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's something, I guess 🙄
6/12/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want a beer, it's so unfair
6/12/19, 01:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/12/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not finished, but rather close
6/12/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: For real this time 😂
6/12/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will try to make a few improvements
6/12/19, 01:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
6/12/19, 01:36 - Sara: Now with my pijama

6/23/19, 15:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it makes sense, otherwise they will keep sending you tax forms
6/23/19, 15:49 - Sara: Yup
6/23/19, 15:51 - Sara: https://stad.gent/burgerzaken/migratie-integratie/verblijf-inschrijving/internationale-studenten/international-students-departure-belgium
6/23/19, 15:52 - Sara: A student who is definitively leaving abroad, should report his departure at the municipal administration within 8 working days prior to his departure date.

This notification occurs by means of the departure form.

This entirely filled in and undersigned departure form can -together with the registration document (E card)- be handed over to the Migration Counter at the Administrative Centre Zuid or via the competent service centre. Furthermore, this entirely filled in and undersigned departure form can -together with the registration document (E card)- also be returned by mail (to: Stad Gent, Stadhuis Gent (tav loket Migratie), Botermarkt 1  9000 Gent).

The student receives a proof of notification (model 8 – Proof of removal of the National Register). If the notification is done by mail or e-mail, this proof of notification is sent to the address abroad mentioned in the departure form.  

Please bear in mind
This removal from the National Register is sometimes very important: 
•	For instance because Dutch cities are asking this departure form from students in order to be registered in a Dutch city
•	Sometimes, this departure form is necessary in order to settle certain customs formalities at the airport in view of exporting goods.
The return and annulation of the registration document (E card) is compulsory. At the Migration Counter the student obtains an annex 37 – Attestation of removal (valid during 8 days). The student should present himself in person with one passport photo.
Please bear in mind
This registration document (E card) should only be returned subsequent to handling all formalities for which this document is required (e.g. bank transactions)

7/2/19, 16:20 - Sara: 6 mountains
7/2/19, 16:20 - Sara: Me, smart
7/2/19, 16:21 - Sara: How is it going,
7/2/19, 16:21 - Sara: ?
7/2/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: not terrible, still haven't done anything though 🙃
7/2/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: so it's more like how is it standing
7/2/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: or sitting
7/2/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: or laying
7/2/19, 16:24 - Sara: C’mone Kamil! Save the day 💪
7/2/19, 16:25 - Sara: Which exercises do you do normally? Like push ups
7/2/19, 16:25 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/2/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean that right now nothing is going
7/2/19, 16:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe tomorrow will be better 🤣
7/2/19, 16:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: depends on what exactly you want to achieve, I suppose
7/2/19, 16:27 - Sara: Gain strenght
7/2/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: with or without equipment?
7/2/19, 16:27 - Sara: Without, just training with my own weight
7/2/19, 16:28 - Sara: Anything in mind?
7/2/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: just arms or other parts too?
7/2/19, 16:29 - Sara: Everything 😂
7/2/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, lately (before it got too hot xd) I was working on abs
7/2/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I'm using an app on my phone
7/2/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: too many exercises to just list them all
7/2/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: also it's better to change the exercises between sessions rather than keep doing the same
7/2/19, 16:33 - Sara: Oh yeah
7/2/19, 16:33 - Sara: I’ll try to find one useful

7/3/19, 01:23 - Sara: When to talk about travelling? 😌

7/7/19, 11:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm beginning to be scared
7/7/19, 11:01 - Sara: Why? :o
7/7/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Somehow you always write this almost the exact moment I wake up 🤔
7/7/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you watching me?
7/7/19, 11:02 - Sara: No.........
7/7/19, 11:02 - Sara: No way 😛
7/7/19, 11:02 - Sara: Maybe i wake you up
7/7/19, 11:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, I woke up 2 minutes ago
7/7/19, 11:03 - Sara: Lol
7/7/19, 11:04 - Sara: Coincidence? I don’t think so
7/7/19, 11:04 - Sara: How are you?
7/7/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine, as mentioned, just woke up
7/7/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y tú?
7/7/19, 11:05 - Sara: Estoy bien
7/7/19, 11:05 - Sara: But my ex is killing my self esteem so much 😂
7/7/19, 11:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Qué pasa?
7/7/19, 11:06 - Sara: You may think is stupid
7/7/19, 11:07 - Sara: But he used to say “oh, i don’t need to upload photos with you in the social media”
7/7/19, 11:07 - Sara: Literally i don’t appear in his instagram
7/7/19, 11:07 - Sara: Only a photo with the band we had
7/7/19, 11:07 - Sara: And now i’m seeing his girlfriend, probably, everywhere
7/7/19, 11:08 - Sara: So i’m thinking he has been lying to me all this time and didn’t value me
7/7/19, 11:08 - Sara: I’m still hurt, la verdad
7/7/19, 11:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe she asks him to post photos?
7/7/19, 11:09 - Sara: I don’t think so
7/7/19, 11:10 - Sara: But meh
7/7/19, 11:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe he is an asshole, difficult to say for me
7/7/19, 11:10 - Sara: He treated me so rude after the breakup
7/7/19, 11:10 - Sara: Idk man
7/7/19, 11:10 - Sara: Not an asshole but... immature probably
7/7/19, 11:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Try not to think about it too much
7/7/19, 11:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's no use anymore
7/7/19, 11:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only hurts
7/7/19, 11:11 - Sara: Difficult 😂 but i’ll try
7/7/19, 11:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know it's difficult, if it wasn't life would be so much easier 😔
7/7/19, 11:12 - Sara: It’s just.. rage
7/7/19, 11:12 - Sara: Yep, agree
7/7/19, 11:12 - Sara: Why people treat me bad? 😂💋
7/7/19, 11:12 - Sara: But well, just a phrase to face
7/7/19, 11:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: They notice your internal need to be a bad bitch 😂
7/7/19, 11:13 - Sara: But agh
7/7/19, 11:13 - Sara: Probably hahaha
7/7/19, 11:13 - Sara: Idk
7/7/19, 11:13 - Sara: I feel that people have moved on
7/7/19, 11:14 - Sara: And changed
7/7/19, 11:14 - Sara: And i’m like c:
7/7/19, 11:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's been a long time, it is probably true that people are different now
7/7/19, 11:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Give it some time
7/7/19, 11:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: You probably will have to adapt a bit to the new situation
7/7/19, 11:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess that's the price of going international 😢
7/7/19, 11:15 - Sara: Yeah
7/7/19, 11:16 - Sara: This week before going to Vienna will be curious 😂
7/7/19, 11:16 - Sara: Totally
7/7/19, 11:16 - Sara: Now i would live even in Poland 😂
7/7/19, 11:16 - Sara: Thank God that the Pole dance class gives me life
7/7/19, 11:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: You say that like it's the worst place ever
7/7/19, 11:17 - Sara: You say it 😂
7/7/19, 11:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed 🤝
7/7/19, 11:18 - Sara: I told you
7/7/19, 11:18 - Sara: I really liked Warsova
7/7/19, 11:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You've been only in Warsaw?
7/7/19, 11:19 - Sara: Maybe I told you the anecdote
7/7/19, 11:19 - Sara: In Poland? Yes
7/7/19, 11:20 - Sara: Why do you ask it?
7/7/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just to know, maybe later we can visit some other places
7/7/19, 11:20 - Sara: Please ♥🌝
7/7/19, 11:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: From Warsaw it's quite easy to get to Krakow by train
7/7/19, 11:21 - Sara: The same in Spain
7/7/19, 11:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also maybe Gdansk, on the coast
7/7/19, 11:21 - Sara: Maybe by bus, depending on the place also
7/7/19, 11:21 - Sara: Never heard about it
7/7/19, 11:22 - Sara: Beach village?
7/7/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, a city
7/7/19, 11:22 - Sara: Like osteend?
7/7/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that
7/7/19, 11:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Much bigger though
7/7/19, 11:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Almost half a million people
7/7/19, 11:23 - Sara: Oh nice 🤗
7/7/19, 11:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a pretty nice, historic place
7/7/19, 11:24 - Sara: In my case, because we are in the centre of the country is not that difficult to get to other places in Spain 😊
7/7/19, 11:24 - Sara: Nice ♥
7/7/19, 11:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar in my case
7/7/19, 11:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although it is around 5-6 hours to get to the edges
7/7/19, 11:25 - Sara: We will see 🌝
7/7/19, 11:25 - Sara: In a week or something we can talk about travelling
7/7/19, 11:25 - Sara: The same
7/7/19, 11:26 - Sara: 🥰
7/7/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you in a car now?
7/7/19, 11:26 - Sara: Yep!
7/7/19, 11:26 - Sara: We are going to Lugo
7/7/19, 11:27 - Sara: And then to Astorga
7/7/19, 11:27 - Sara: Quite nice 🤗
7/7/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, watch the commercial I told you about before
7/7/19, 11:27 - Sara: Okay now
7/7/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's nice 😊
7/7/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: So no Asturias after all?
7/7/19, 11:29 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHHA
7/7/19, 11:29 - Sara: I’m the girl

7/7/19, 11:42 - Sara: Which one are you? Mmm
7/7/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you were going to come up with something funny but I guess it was just your standard way of making jokes
7/7/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Say something and hope someone else finishes the joke 🤣
7/7/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Brava 😉
7/7/19, 12:42 - Sara: Hahaha
7/7/19, 12:43 - Sara: I thought you were going to answer
7/7/19, 12:43 - Sara: I tried to find a disney character but i could not
7/7/19, 12:43 - Sara: But i had a nap and we have just arrived
7/7/19, 12:43 - Sara: Also you must be busy
7/7/19, 12:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: not really
7/7/19, 12:45 - Sara: Talk to you later
7/7/19, 12:45 - Sara: You can write me and i text you later ;)
7/7/19, 12:45 - Sara: Te quiero

7/7/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Que te vaya bien 🥰
7/7/19, 12:46 - Sara: Gracias 💋
7/7/19, 12:46 - Sara: Idem :p
7/7/19, 12:46 - Sara: = the same, it’s a latin term
7/7/19, 13:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 13:14 - Sara: There are coins here 😌
7/7/19, 13:14 - Sara: Always on alert 😂
7/7/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lugo, I never heard of it before
7/7/19, 13:15 - Sara: One of the four provinces in Galicia
7/7/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: before erasmus I also never heard of Galicia so I guess no surprise I don't know it 😂
7/7/19, 13:16 - Sara: Hahaha it’s okay
7/7/19, 13:16 - Sara: I understand it
7/7/19, 13:16 - Sara: It’s like a village
7/7/19, 13:16 - Sara: It has roman monuments
7/7/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: just checked, 100 thousand inhabitants
7/7/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: so yeah, rather small
7/7/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that's nice anyway
7/7/19, 13:17 - Sara: Toledo is 40,000 hahaha
7/7/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: everything in Spain has roman monuments
7/7/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: wikipedia says 84 000
7/7/19, 13:23 - Sara: Oh
7/7/19, 13:23 - Sara: Well, still smaller haha
7/7/19, 13:23 - Sara: But better than Lugo :p
7/7/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's quite interesting, Ghent has like 3 times more people but is 1/3 smaller than Toledo
7/7/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: and Lodz has like 8 times more and is only like 15% bigger
7/7/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: so Toledo is actually not that small
7/7/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: but seems kind of empty
7/7/19, 13:32 - Sara: Lmao
7/7/19, 13:32 - Sara: Yes, i noticed it
7/7/19, 13:32 - Sara: Because it is more touristic
7/7/19, 13:32 - Sara: Man, there is a book market and it’s so nice 😭😭😭
7/7/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why 😭😭😭 ?
7/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: A lot of books but no money haha
7/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: Also i miss reading
7/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: A lot
7/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: I want to go to the library and study
7/7/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: you can do that soon
7/7/19, 13:34 - Sara: Yep
7/7/19, 13:35 - Sara: I hope
7/7/19, 13:35 - Sara: I don’t want to feel silly anymore haha
7/7/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 13:36 - Sara: I wish 😂
7/7/19, 13:46 - Sara: Btw
7/7/19, 13:46 - Sara: Which kind of books do you like? Do you have any novel that you like the most?
7/7/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I really liked all the witcher books
7/7/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: sadly, lately I haven't been reading many novels
7/7/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: mostly engineering, programming, science books
7/7/19, 13:50 - Sara: For uni?
7/7/19, 13:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: of the more notable I've also read song of ice and fire and metro 2033
7/7/19, 13:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
7/7/19, 13:56 - Sara: Metro 2033?
7/7/19, 13:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I've read tons of historical novels in school and I really liked them
7/7/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: but they were mostly polish so titles won't really tell you anything
7/7/19, 14:14 - Sara: Oh yeah
7/7/19, 14:14 - Sara: I read some also in high school
7/7/19, 14:15 - Sara: If they are in english, they can be nice
7/7/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: yay, I checked on ryanairs website and there are actually quite convenient flights between Warsaw and Madrid
7/7/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't understand why they didn't popup when I was searching on other websites
7/7/19, 14:16 - Sara: Really?
7/7/19, 14:16 - Sara: So nice ☺☺☺☺
7/7/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe because it's from the second airport in Warsaw
7/7/19, 14:16 - Sara: And is it worse?
7/7/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: smaller
7/7/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: but doesn't really make any difference for me from which one I go
7/7/19, 14:17 - Sara: But in communication is the same?
7/7/19, 14:17 - Sara: I mean to the centre
7/7/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: nop, It's outside of the city
7/7/19, 14:19 - Sara: The other one is within?
7/7/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: close to it
7/7/19, 14:21 - Sara: Nice
7/7/19, 14:22 - Sara: In ryanair right? I can check it
7/7/19, 14:22 - Sara: For the future 😌🌝
7/7/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: one at the bottom is probably where you arrived before
7/7/19, 14:23 - Sara: Oh
7/7/19, 14:23 - Sara: Yep, i remember the name
7/7/19, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: but from there, there are only cheap flights to Barcelona
7/7/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: to Madrid is much more difficult
7/7/19, 14:24 - Sara: Uf.. Barcelona is sooo expensive
7/7/19, 14:24 - Sara: But i can check it
7/7/19, 14:24 - Sara: 🤗
7/7/19, 14:25 - Sara: And why checking them?
7/7/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: no particular reason, just thought about it now
7/7/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I enjoy checking these things
7/7/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: even if I'm not planning yet, I like to check that
7/7/19, 14:26 - Sara: I want to plan asap
7/7/19, 14:26 - Sara: That means that i know when i can ser you again
7/7/19, 14:26 - Sara: 😊
7/7/19, 14:26 - Sara: See*
7/7/19, 14:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope to know more next week
7/7/19, 14:27 - Sara: Nice 🥰
7/7/19, 14:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: there are connections from the other airport straight to the center
7/7/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: it takes about 1 hour so not too bad
7/7/19, 14:28 - Sara: 1 hour? Well, it can be worse
7/7/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, but the flight is 40-50 euro instead 200-300
7/7/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: so, worth it, I suppose
7/7/19, 14:29 - Sara: Yep
7/7/19, 14:29 - Sara: Really is that the difference? Damn
7/7/19, 14:29 - Sara: Both prices for Spain?
7/7/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't checked yet, now I saw flights from Poland to Spain
7/7/19, 14:30 - Sara: Yeah i know
7/7/19, 14:30 - Sara: Well, i understand myself xSd
7/7/19, 14:31 - Sara: XD
7/7/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: cheapest, without stops 157euro
7/7/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: with stops 95
7/7/19, 14:32 - Sara: Mmmmmm
7/7/19, 14:32 - Sara: Well, not bad
7/7/19, 14:33 - Sara: For august?
7/7/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: 7th of august
7/7/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was just checking different days, this was the cheapest one
7/7/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: no plans yet
7/7/19, 14:34 - Sara: 👍
7/7/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: but other days are not much more expensive
7/7/19, 14:34 - Sara: Oh perfect
7/7/19, 14:34 - Sara: You prefer me going to Poland?
7/7/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 14:38 - Sara: Ñeeee
7/7/19, 14:38 - Sara: Ñeeee
7/7/19, 14:38 - Sara: Okay, it can be nice
7/7/19, 14:39 - Sara: And what about Prague? Or for another time?
7/7/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, it was just a suggestion
7/7/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how much time do you want to spend abroad
7/7/19, 14:40 - Sara: That’s a good question
7/7/19, 14:40 - Sara: Also the when
7/7/19, 14:41 - Sara: I want to have under control everything for the next course
7/7/19, 14:41 - Sara: I hope to know everything in a week or something
7/7/19, 14:41 - Sara: Or at least before going to Vienna
7/7/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll try to find out 🤝
7/7/19, 14:42 - Sara: 😊👌🏻
7/7/19, 14:42 - Sara: I’m getting dizzy

7/7/19, 18:00 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
7/7/19, 18:00 - Sara: Everybody loves Poland in summer, right?
7/7/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: depends how well you sunbathe
7/7/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: either Poland if not so well
7/7/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: or Soviet union if very well

7/7/19, 19:11 - Sara: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=41.55143356323242,-5.07703161239624
7/7/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought that you would be more or less near Valladolid now
7/7/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still a long way to go
7/7/19, 19:12 - Sara: And i’m near
7/7/19, 19:12 - Sara: Yes...
7/7/19, 19:12 - Sara: Probably i’ll sleep again haha
7/7/19, 19:12 - Sara: What have you been doing?
7/7/19, 19:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish, I also started to think about my trip to Poland
7/7/19, 19:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: More or less the prices
7/7/19, 19:14 - Sara: 😢
7/7/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I found out that Ryanair also goes from Brussels to that airport I didn't know about
7/7/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's cheaper than Wizz air and also at much better hour
7/7/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I'm quite happy with that discovery
7/7/19, 19:14 - Sara: The airport you mentioned before?
7/7/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
7/7/19, 19:15 - Sara: Nice!
7/7/19, 19:15 - Sara: Have you thought about the date?
7/7/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably first week of August
7/7/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: End of July is somewhat expensive
7/7/19, 19:16 - Sara: And not the beginning of the month?
7/7/19, 19:16 - Sara: Or poland is not a place to go in summer? Haha
7/7/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: First week of August is the beginning of the month
7/7/19, 19:17 - Sara: I mean
7/7/19, 19:17 - Sara: If it is not expensive
7/7/19, 19:17 - Sara: Normally it is
7/7/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah
7/7/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not sure why
7/7/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe just because it's later
7/7/19, 19:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: End of August flights are for 10 euro
7/7/19, 19:18 - Sara: As well
7/7/19, 19:18 - Sara: Damn
7/7/19, 19:19 - Sara: With the suitcase included?
7/7/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, just the hand luggage
7/7/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't checked with baggage yet
7/7/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's cheap anyway
7/7/19, 19:20 - Sara: That nice!
7/7/19, 19:20 - Sara: And anything else? :)
7/7/19, 19:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
7/7/19, 19:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 19:21 - Sara: One hour checking flights haha
7/7/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I was also revising spanish
7/7/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most of that time actually
7/7/19, 19:21 - Sara: Oh true
7/7/19, 19:21 - Sara: What are you learning now?
7/7/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, just vocab
7/7/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: After that I'll check grammar from my app
7/7/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then in the next days hopefully I'll finally progress forward
7/7/19, 19:23 - Sara: Yay
7/7/19, 19:23 - Sara: What do you mean with that? Another level or something?
7/7/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next lessons, lately I haven't done anything new outside of vocab
7/7/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: First I need to revise those things
7/7/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise it's kind of pointless to continue
7/7/19, 19:25 - Sara: Yeah
7/7/19, 19:25 - Sara: Fair enough
7/7/19, 19:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/7/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would probably know more by now but Spanish had very bad influence on my Spanish learning 😋
7/7/19, 19:26 - Sara: Why? 😱
7/7/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: No tiempo para aprender
7/7/19, 19:28 - Sara: I would say no hay tiempo para aprender :p
7/7/19, 19:28 - Sara: Not learning spanish
7/7/19, 19:28 - Sara: But learning how to be a cutie
7/7/19, 19:28 - Sara: And how to fuck 🤪😂
7/7/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara de la Torre and her subscription to fucking websites
7/7/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are like Niccolo now
7/7/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doing "research"

7/8/19, 13:23 - Sara: Love you 😘
7/8/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry about it, focus on your things 💋
7/8/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:30 - Sara: Hahaha is it real?
7/8/19, 13:30 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/8/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Apparently yes
7/8/19, 13:30 - Sara: Between i dreamt with my ex giving me anxiety and the failed exam... puf
7/8/19, 13:31 - Sara: We should go back ♥
7/8/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely 😍
7/8/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw why arthropoda is following me on Instagram?
7/8/19, 13:32 - Sara: Because you are the chosen one
7/8/19, 13:32 - Sara: Why were you following us? 😂
7/8/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's normal to follow bands, I guess
7/8/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although I have to say I don't remember following you 🤔
7/8/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
7/8/19, 13:34 - Sara: It appeared in the notifications haha
7/8/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I know that I do, just don't remember when I started
7/8/19, 13:35 - Sara: 1 week? Xd
7/8/19, 13:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nooo, ya basta por favor 😬
7/8/19, 13:36 - Sara: Hahahaha
7/8/19, 13:36 - Sara: Soorry
7/8/19, 13:36 - Sara: What are you doing?
7/8/19, 13:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm continuing revising Spanish for now
7/8/19, 13:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later I intend to study some programming and maybe write something for my thesis
7/8/19, 13:40 - Sara: Nice :)
7/8/19, 13:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to do a video call or something later, I'm interested
7/8/19, 13:40 - Sara: Okaay
7/8/19, 13:41 - Sara: I want to try the one in messenger
7/8/19, 13:41 - Sara: I tell you
7/8/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's pretty much the same as whatsapp
7/8/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just with messenger I can use my computer
7/8/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: And with WhatsApp not
7/8/19, 13:41 - Sara: Nice ^^ okay okay
7/8/19, 13:41 - Sara: Really? Mmm i can see
7/8/19, 13:42 - Sara: There is an app for computers
7/8/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok I was just using the web app which doesn't support videocalls
7/8/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But for messenger I didn't need to install anything
7/8/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just login to Facebook in my browser
7/8/19, 13:44 - Sara: 👌🏻
7/8/19, 13:44 - Sara: Okaay
7/8/19, 13:44 - Sara: Then i can tell you which one is better
7/8/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: They are both owned by Facebook so it's probably almost the same
7/8/19, 13:46 - Sara: Skype as well?
7/8/19, 13:46 - Sara: This is a sect xD
7/8/19, 13:46 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's nice, I think only Skype can do that
7/8/19, 13:48 - Sara: Yep
7/8/19, 13:48 - Sara: But we can try everything
7/8/19, 13:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yay, it arrived 😁
7/8/19, 13:56 - Sara: It’s about to explode haha
7/8/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do an unboxing on instagram
7/8/19, 13:57 - Sara: It arrived when i was at the festival
7/8/19, 13:57 - Sara: Not worth it xD
7/8/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pleeeeeease
7/8/19, 13:58 - Sara: For you maybe xD
7/8/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 13:58 - Sara: But i don’t have interesting stuff jaja
7/8/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, life unboxing
7/8/19, 14:00 - Sara: Whyyyy
7/8/19, 14:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:05 - Sara: Not amazing
7/8/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Too dark
7/8/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like your soul 🖤
7/8/19, 14:08 - Sara: Aw ♥
7/8/19, 14:08 - Sara: Do you think i’m dark?
7/8/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, you just pretend
7/8/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: In reality 🌈
7/8/19, 14:09 - Sara: I know
7/8/19, 14:09 - Sara: Too ga
7/8/19, 14:09 - Sara: Gay*
7/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: Yours is yellow ☺
7/8/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why yellow?
7/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: Because you hate it and i like it
7/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: :p
7/8/19, 14:11 - Sara: Idk, i haven’t noticed your aura
7/8/19, 14:12 - Sara: It was weird once when i notices a person’s aura, it was dark green
7/8/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eeeh?
7/8/19, 14:13 - Sara: Do you know what is the aura?
7/8/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, imaginary thing probably
7/8/19, 14:13 - Sara: 😢
7/8/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't tend to hallucinate
7/8/19, 14:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:14 - Sara: :,(
7/8/19, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes but it doesn't have a visible color
7/8/19, 14:15 - Sara: Normally yes
7/8/19, 14:15 - Sara: I think
7/8/19, 14:16 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not physical at all, just a feeling based on qualities of something
7/8/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you seriously into this?
7/8/19, 14:17 - Sara: Too mathematical...
7/8/19, 14:17 - Sara: Not into 100% but i saw it 😂
7/8/19, 14:17 - Sara: What is this?
7/8/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spiritual mambo jambo 😋
7/8/19, 14:18 - Sara: Mambo jambo hahaha
7/8/19, 14:18 - Sara: I’m not a strong believer of that
7/8/19, 14:18 - Sara: But i find it interesting
7/8/19, 14:18 - Sara: Not everything in life has to be rational
7/8/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: People are often not rational, nature is
7/8/19, 14:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:19 - Sara: Mmmmmmm
7/8/19, 14:19 - Sara: But not everything can be explained
7/8/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't mean it's not rational, we just don't have enough knowledge to explain it
7/8/19, 14:21 - Sara: Yep
7/8/19, 14:21 - Sara: It is not the opposite
7/8/19, 14:21 - Sara: Maybe this cannot be explained yet
7/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: I would like to do more research about this
7/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: I used to be very spiritual
7/8/19, 14:24 - Sara: Probably i told you i had a period when i tried to find a religion or something to “believe”, more into budism and meditation
7/8/19, 14:26 - Sara: I think people tend to close their minds in this kind of topics
7/8/19, 14:27 - Sara: Yass, ghost comes to Spain ♥
7/8/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I just never felt the need to believe in anything spiritual
7/8/19, 14:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 14:42 - Sara: Or what do you think?
7/8/19, 14:42 - Sara: It’s a very good topic to discuss
7/8/19, 14:42 - Sara: 😃
7/8/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never really had any interest in that, I like to rationalize everything and delving into these topics never actually caught my attention
7/8/19, 14:46 - Sara: Oh okay
7/8/19, 14:46 - Sara: I’ll try to read about that
7/8/19, 16:09 - Sara: Btw, i'll be free soon
7/8/19, 16:09 - Sara: if you want to talk
7/8/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, sounds good
7/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: via messenger?
7/8/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: we can try it out
7/8/19, 16:11 - Sara: okay i tell you
7/8/19, 16:16 - Sara: I’m going now
7/8/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Wroclaw
7/8/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Krakow
7/8/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Gdansk
7/8/19, 17:32 - Sara: Sorry
7/8/19, 17:32 - Sara: Not being used to be sad in fron of cameras 😂
7/8/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want, later when I meet with others we can do a video call again
7/8/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: This time should be a bit easier to talk
7/8/19, 17:33 - Sara: Don’t worry
7/8/19, 17:33 - Sara: It’s okay
7/8/19, 17:33 - Sara: Have fun and do productive stuff 🤗
7/8/19, 17:33 - Sara: I need time, that’s it
7/8/19, 17:34 - Sara: And need go be used to be here
7/8/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand, I also have that issue and I haven't even went home yet
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: Idk
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: I feel sad in general
7/8/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: But it is okay
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: ♥💋
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: Probably loneliness or sense of loss
7/8/19, 17:39 - Sara: Idk
7/8/19, 17:41 - Sara: But it’s about time
7/8/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: We always knew the end would come, eventually
7/8/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it is part of the journey
7/8/19, 17:41 - Sara: Not for erasmus
7/8/19, 17:41 - Sara: Obvious
7/8/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: And at least for me, it was worth it
7/8/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Even if it makes me sad now
7/8/19, 17:42 - Sara: Think the same
7/8/19, 17:43 - Sara: Now I don’t feel like doing anything
7/8/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Take a few days off, you don't really need to do much now
7/8/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: You did well, you deserve some off time
7/8/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then you should reconnect with your friends a bit and that should help
7/8/19, 17:45 - Sara: Friends xd
7/8/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your life obviously is not going to be the same as before
7/8/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that was the point, to change something
7/8/19, 17:46 - Sara: Yeah but idk
7/8/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people is great but it also gives you this annoying sense of longing
7/8/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's the price for these new experiences
7/8/19, 17:47 - Sara: Yep
7/8/19, 17:47 - Sara: Idk
7/8/19, 17:47 - Sara: I think is more than that
7/8/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dime más
7/8/19, 17:48 - Sara: Ex stuff
7/8/19, 17:48 - Sara: Music stiff
7/8/19, 17:48 - Sara: Stuff*
7/8/19, 17:48 - Sara: Uni stuff*
7/8/19, 17:49 - Sara: Feeling alone and treated as shit stuff
7/8/19, 17:49 - Sara: Not knowing who is there stuff
7/8/19, 17:50 - Sara: Unable to change stuff
7/8/19, 17:50 - Sara: Normal stuff 😂
7/8/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to tell you that everything will be fine because obviously I don't know that but give it some time
7/8/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rome wasn't built in one day
7/8/19, 17:50 - Sara: Yeah
7/8/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't torture yourself
7/8/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only I can do that
7/8/19, 17:51 - Sara: Okay thanks
7/8/19, 17:51 - Sara: I will see

7/8/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't responded with I know for some time now
7/8/19, 17:54 - Sara: Oh haha true

7/8/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
7/8/19, 17:54 - Sara: 😂
7/8/19, 17:55 - Sara: Maybe not in the mood
7/8/19, 17:55 - Sara: Sorry
7/8/19, 17:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need more cats
7/8/19, 17:55 - Sara: I want to disappear

7/8/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, probably
7/8/19, 18:01 - Sara: But i don’t want people seeing my face arg
7/8/19, 18:01 - Sara: I’ll wait
7/8/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: eh?

7/8/19, 19:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you have enough problems and I'm not exactly helping
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: Again
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: I should get used to you
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: And you are not my baby-sitter who has to please me all the time
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: If that is your personality, i have to accept it or reject it
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: Not changing it
7/8/19, 19:37 - Sara: That’s up to you
7/8/19, 19:38 - Sara: It is also that i’m not good emotionally talking
7/8/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I could do something
7/8/19, 19:41 - Sara: So everything can affect me slightly more
7/8/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot promise you that I won't worry because I will but I'll try to feel better if you promise that you will too 😘
7/8/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: eh, I just want to hug you and I cannot and it makes me sad 😢

7/9/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: building up the tension
7/9/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: suspense, bitch

7/9/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do, I have a full folder of it
7/9/19, 01:10 - Sara: But i expect feedback xD
7/9/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Impossible, I don't have enough hands
7/9/19, 01:10 - Sara: hahahaha
7/9/19, 01:11 - Sara: Oh
7/9/19, 01:11 - Sara: Busy cooking
7/9/19, 01:11 - Sara: xD
7/9/19, 01:11 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1CQTSC7ctU&list=WL&index=5 This one is nice
7/9/19, 01:11 - Sara: But idk what you think about them
7/9/19, 01:16 - Sara: but yeah
7/9/19, 01:16 - Sara: i wanted to ask you something
7/9/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: go ahead
7/9/19, 01:17 - Sara: What time do you need me? I mean
7/9/19, 01:18 - Sara: How much time we should talk and that stuff
7/9/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: ufff, hard question
7/9/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: at the moment I don't mind as often as possible
7/9/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: but later it will probably be different
7/9/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: small conversations throughout the day are nice
7/9/19, 01:19 - Sara: Why?
7/9/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: and from time to time a longer one, preferably not by text
7/9/19, 01:20 - Sara: Agree
7/9/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I don't know how my life is going to look
7/9/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, when I find the job it's probably a bit different, timewise
7/9/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really know beacuse it's going to be kind of new to me
7/9/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: unexplored territory
7/9/19, 01:21 - Sara: Okay
7/9/19, 01:21 - Sara: Just to have it in mind 😚
7/9/19, 01:21 - Sara: Don’t worry about that
7/9/19, 01:22 - Sara: I didn’t know the time we had to spend on that
7/9/19, 01:23 - Sara: Idk if it was because my mood wasn’t the best and really needed to talk with you or because i don’t know how to distribute the time, i think i didn’t do the stuff i wanted to do for today
7/9/19, 01:23 - Sara: And, in a small degree, worries me
7/9/19, 01:23 - Sara: I mean
7/9/19, 01:23 - Sara: Maybe the time “i need you” is not the same as the time “you need me”
7/9/19, 01:24 - Sara: I’m afraid of someone of us employing too much time on the other
7/9/19, 01:24 - Sara: I had this episodes in the past and... i didn’t like them at all
7/9/19, 01:24 - Sara: Yeah, everything is in the air for me as well
7/9/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think this is one of those things that are better to discuss by calling then texting
7/9/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: but for me, I don't feel tired by you
7/9/19, 01:25 - Sara: Yep, i agree
7/9/19, 01:25 - Sara: I didn’t say the opposite
7/9/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: whenever you need to talk, I'm here for you
7/9/19, 01:25 - Sara: I say the same
7/9/19, 01:26 - Sara: If i can help you, i’ll be there always
7/9/19, 01:26 - Sara: 🥰💋💕♥

7/9/19, 01:30 - Sara: I really hate being in Toledo
7/9/19, 01:30 - Sara: Because my family accumulates a lot
7/9/19, 01:30 - Sara: And in Ghent and in Madrid i have the only things I need
7/9/19, 01:30 - Sara: That stresses me a lot 😂
7/9/19, 01:31 - Sara: So i’ll need it haha
7/9/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you finally getting your satisfyer???

7/9/19, 01:32 - Sara: My life will be better
7/9/19, 01:33 - Sara: The same but at least i have orgasms
7/9/19, 01:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: that is a significant improvement
7/9/19, 01:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so remember about the videos tomorrow
7/9/19, 01:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y buenas noches 😘
7/9/19, 01:34 - Sara: Going to sleep already?
7/9/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: me? no
7/9/19, 01:34 - Sara: Why do you want to see me failing? 😂
7/9/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I thought that you were
7/9/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: obviously I do
7/9/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it will motivate you to give more effort
7/9/19, 01:34 - Sara: And btw, i like sharing even the smallest things that happen to me... so if i’m to annoying, you tell me
7/9/19, 01:35 - Sara: I hope
7/9/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's not annoying at all
7/9/19, 01:35 - Sara: Reading this does not help haha
7/9/19, 01:35 - Sara: Okay ☺
7/9/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe sometimes I won't reply but that would just mean that I was a bit busy
7/9/19, 01:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: but share them anyway
7/9/19, 01:36 - Sara: Okay donught worry
7/9/19, 01:36 - Sara: Okay 😁
7/9/19, 01:36 - Sara: I say the same for you
7/9/19, 01:36 - Sara: But maybe you are more discrete
7/9/19, 01:36 - Sara: I’m like
7/9/19, 01:37 - Sara: OH A FLY **photo**
7/9/19, 01:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: OH A MOSQUITO, FUCK YOU MOSQUITO *SMACK*
7/9/19, 01:37 - Sara: That’s you 😂
7/9/19, 01:38 - Sara: But yeah
7/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: Me being too innocent 😂
7/9/19, 01:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you have a lot of mosquitos in Spain?
7/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: Mmmm
7/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: Depending on the place
7/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: But yeah
7/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: And in poland?
7/9/19, 01:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: also depends, I live outside of the city so typically yes
7/9/19, 01:40 - Sara: Fuck them all 😂
7/9/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 01:41 - Sara: Kamil, do you think i’m extremely delicate?
7/9/19, 01:41 - Sara: Nice 🥰
7/9/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: in what meaning?
7/9/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: physically?
7/9/19, 01:42 - Sara: Mmmmm i was thinking emotionally
7/9/19, 01:42 - Sara: But now i’m curious 😂
7/9/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I definitely wouldn't say extremely but it wouldn't hurt if you cared less about what people think about you
7/9/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Physically not at all 😂
7/9/19, 01:44 - Sara: Yeah, i get offended easily
7/9/19, 01:44 - Sara: But idk, i always think that people is mocking at me or something
7/9/19, 01:44 - Sara: It’s weird
7/9/19, 01:44 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: the point is that even if they do, you just shouldn't be bothered
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: Mmmmmm
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: I don’t care when i don’t carr about that people
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: Care*
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: Probably
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: I don’t know
7/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: Night and overthinking is not a good combination haha
7/9/19, 01:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it also depends on the kind of mocking
7/9/19, 01:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: because as you probably noticed often in our group there was friendly mocking
7/9/19, 01:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: which in my opinion is fine
7/9/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: we know not to take it seriously
7/9/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: but if it's meant to hurt people than it's wrong
7/9/19, 01:47 - Sara: Ouh, we had this conversation
7/9/19, 01:47 - Sara: But yeah
7/9/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably, we had a lot of them 😁
7/9/19, 01:48 - Sara: Probably
7/9/19, 01:48 - Sara: Sometimes is hard to discern 😂
7/9/19, 01:48 - Sara: Depending on the mood or the kind of message
7/9/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: true which is why I don't take seriously any sort of mocking
7/9/19, 01:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it's the good one I shouldn't, if it's the bad one I shouldn't either so easy peasy really
7/9/19, 01:49 - Sara: Yeah
7/9/19, 01:49 - Sara: Good way of seeing it
7/9/19, 01:49 - Sara: Idk
7/9/19, 01:49 - Sara: It’s about knowing the others
7/9/19, 01:50 - Sara: And also what you think about yourself
7/9/19, 01:51 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 01:51 - Sara: Idk why i still have this issues 😂
7/9/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: they are not exactly easy to get rid off
7/9/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: especially if your friends sometimes go to far
7/9/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I'm quite aware that I'm guilty of this myself
7/9/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
7/9/19, 01:52 - Sara: When is it a joke and when is it a truth?
7/9/19, 01:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me it's just based on my own view of myself
7/9/19, 01:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't care if somebody acts like an asshole
7/9/19, 01:54 - Sara: I don’t get it
7/9/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, like they can say something mean to me but I know that it is not actually true so it doesn't make me feel bad
7/9/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll just respond with something mean myself
7/9/19, 01:55 - Sara: Understandable
7/9/19, 01:55 - Sara: You should not
7/9/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it stays that way I just assume that they don't like and I moveon
7/9/19, 01:55 - Sara: 😣
7/9/19, 01:56 - Sara: Yeah, fair enough
7/9/19, 01:56 - Sara: Maybe it’s about getting used to that and to you
7/9/19, 01:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, but I give chances, like I don't just abandon everything at first sign of trouble
7/9/19, 01:57 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that sometimes these kinds of things just happen and I don't judge people based on that
7/9/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: unless it is always like that
7/9/19, 01:57 - Sara: People who mock or who is mocked?
7/9/19, 01:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: people mocking me or something of that sort
7/9/19, 01:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: or in general acting mean
7/9/19, 01:58 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 01:58 - Sara: The same
7/9/19, 01:58 - Sara: I try
7/9/19, 01:59 - Sara: But idk it is weird 😂
7/9/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course it's not easy
7/9/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: subtle art of not giving a fuck 🤣
7/9/19, 01:59 - Sara: Depends on the mood, but i don’t trust anybody
7/9/19, 01:59 - Sara: Yeah xD
7/9/19, 01:59 - Sara: Yeah idk
7/9/19, 02:00 - Sara: You mentioned stuff along these period and idk if it is for real
7/9/19, 02:00 - Sara: And btw, do you normally trust people? I remember hearinf you saying you don’t
7/9/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: not too much really
7/9/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: takes me time to actually do that
7/9/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I trust you
7/9/19, 02:01 - Sara: You can say you don’t
7/9/19, 02:01 - Sara: It’s okay
7/9/19, 02:01 - Sara: You mentioned
7/9/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know I can
7/9/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I do
7/9/19, 02:02 - Sara: Okay
7/9/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: you never did anything wrong to me, you're probably the best thing that happened to me
7/9/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is somewhat unusual for me
7/9/19, 02:03 - Sara: Aw 😢♥
7/9/19, 02:03 - Sara: Don’t say that
7/9/19, 02:03 - Sara: I’m sure
7/9/19, 02:03 - Sara: That you have good things in life
7/9/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I didn't say new, just unusual
7/9/19, 02:04 - Sara: Well, inusual...
7/9/19, 02:05 - Sara: Thanks for trusting me
7/9/19, 02:06 - Sara: And btw, when you tell them what is the use of it?
7/9/19, 02:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
7/9/19, 02:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: you mean when do I talk to them about what they were saying?
7/9/19, 02:07 - Sara: Not
7/9/19, 02:07 - Sara: When you mock 😂
7/9/19, 02:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know actually, it's something that kind of happens naturally
7/9/19, 02:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: good friends are rarely nice to each other 🤣
7/9/19, 02:09 - Sara: Okay
7/9/19, 02:09 - Sara: Just to know
7/9/19, 02:09 - Sara: Really?
7/9/19, 02:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: you've seen me, Andraz, Nicco etc
7/9/19, 02:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: often it just kind of happens
7/9/19, 02:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: situational humor
7/9/19, 02:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I guess it's that kind for which you need to know other people quite well
7/9/19, 02:10 - Sara: Also a good way to hide your hate in a joke
7/9/19, 02:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/9/19, 02:11 - Sara: Oh, just knowing how they are
7/9/19, 02:11 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, something like that
7/9/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I'm kind of used to it
7/9/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: never really thought about it too much
7/9/19, 02:12 - Sara: I think about that a lot
7/9/19, 02:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: if someone is comfortable enough with me to do it I know they are my friends
7/9/19, 02:13 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 02:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's not a condition necessary for being my friend
7/9/19, 02:13 - Sara: Ok
7/9/19, 02:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: just saying 🤣
7/9/19, 02:13 - Sara: I think i should go to sleep
7/9/19, 02:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you buenas noches 45 minutes ago
7/9/19, 02:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: you may be right...
7/9/19, 02:14 - Sara: Okay sorry

7/9/19, 02:15 - Sara: 😞
7/9/19, 02:15 - Sara: Okay
7/9/19, 02:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just thought at the moment that you wanted to 😁
7/9/19, 02:15 - Sara: Nice
7/9/19, 02:15 - Sara: See you tomorrow
7/9/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is everything ok?

7/9/19, 02:19 - Sara: Period stuff 😂
7/9/19, 02:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: your period is mocking you???
7/9/19, 02:19 - Sara: I prefer waiting for tomorrow and being calmed that saying it now
7/9/19, 02:19 - Sara: As always
7/9/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, but I will worry
7/9/19, 02:20 - Sara: Again

7/9/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Be happy

7/9/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
7/9/19, 02:20 - Sara: 😁
7/9/19, 02:21 - Sara: Sleep tight
7/9/19, 02:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a strong suspicion that this is not your face right now
7/9/19, 02:21 - Sara: Promise me that
7/9/19, 02:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, I can promise I'll try
7/9/19, 02:22 - Sara: Well

7/9/19, 13:26 - Sara: But idk neither if being like that is a solution 😂
7/9/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was meant as a joke but I guess it was rather poor

7/9/19, 14:33 - Sara: Maybe i have to learn how to introduce myself
7/9/19, 14:33 - Sara: In case i see your parents HAHAHHA
7/9/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😱 😱 😱
7/9/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I doubt that you could use it anywhere outside of Poland
7/9/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But some basics probably won't hurt
7/9/19, 14:35 - Sara: I can try
7/9/19, 14:36 - Sara: I cannot promise anything because i’m a fucking disaster
7/9/19, 14:36 - Sara: But yep

7/9/19, 16:39 - Sara: At least you have one month
7/9/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Technically yes but being here is nowhere nearly as enjoyable as before
7/9/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to add another timer with your photo
7/9/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know which date to set
7/9/19, 16:42 - Sara: 😍😍😍
7/9/19, 16:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now that I think of it, wasn't it mentioned in one of the videos?
7/9/19, 16:43 - Sara: When we buy the tickets
7/9/19, 16:43 - Sara: Yes!
7/9/19, 16:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
7/9/19, 16:44 - Sara: I found a place and i’m happy
7/9/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: A place!? So objectifying, this your dog!
7/9/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy mal
7/9/19, 16:45 - Sara: So especist
7/9/19, 16:45 - Sara: Animals are objects
7/9/19, 16:45 - Sara: That’s the reason why we eat them
7/9/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw do you have any pets?
7/9/19, 16:47 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 16:47 - Sara: It has 22 years old
7/9/19, 16:47 - Sara: With white hair
7/9/19, 16:47 - Sara: HAHAHHHAHA

7/9/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not? Any specific reason?
7/9/19, 16:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 16:49 - Sara: Btw, i’ll be watching videos
7/9/19, 16:49 - Sara: The videos i like
7/9/19, 16:49 - Sara: In case i don’t talk that much
7/9/19, 16:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, makes sense
7/9/19, 16:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have plenty of space for animals at home so I don't really have these problems
7/9/19, 16:54 - Sara: You’re lucky!
7/9/19, 16:54 - Sara: I wish i had that
7/9/19, 16:54 - Sara: I could adopt a lot of animals haha
7/9/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buy a ranch in Arizona
7/9/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cowgirl 🤠
7/9/19, 16:55 - Sara: And marry my cousin 👏🏽
7/9/19, 16:55 - Sara: Cariño, can i ask you a question?
7/9/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure
7/9/19, 16:55 - Sara: How am I in sex?
7/9/19, 16:56 - Sara: I’m watching a video about self-confidence in sex and yeah, i’m curious now
7/9/19, 16:56 - Sara: But this also helps for having better self esteem
7/9/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I definitely enjoy it, personally I think you're quite good
7/9/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not afraid to experiment
7/9/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't focus entirely on yourself
7/9/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing to complain about really
7/9/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you could stretch a bit, it could open some new possibilities 😋
7/9/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall I rate 9/11
7/9/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sex bomb for sure 😍
7/9/19, 17:01 - Sara: Literally open 😂
7/9/19, 17:01 - Sara: I hope this time i improve in that ;)
7/9/19, 17:01 - Sara: You’re so sweet ♥
7/9/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I pick my words carefully
7/9/19, 17:02 - Sara: Thanks ✨
7/9/19, 17:02 - Sara: I know
7/9/19, 17:02 - Sara: I was remembering when you started to shake when we had sex for the first time
7/9/19, 17:02 - Sara: Really, it was so cute and aw ♥
7/9/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do we have to talk about sex, now I'm going to think about it 🤔
7/9/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: So bad Sara, so bad
7/9/19, 17:03 - Sara: Sooorry
7/9/19, 17:03 - Sara: Haha
7/9/19, 17:03 - Sara: I have just watch a video about threesomes
7/9/19, 17:03 - Sara: And i haven’t asked (yet) xD
7/9/19, 17:03 - Sara: You have photos ;)
7/9/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 17:05 - Sara: Aw
7/9/19, 17:05 - Sara: Kamil does not like it
7/9/19, 17:05 - Sara: I’ll do stickers with your photos haha
7/9/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 17:10 - Sara: Hahhaa
7/9/19, 17:10 - Sara: What you prefer
7/9/19, 17:10 - Sara: Stickers or talking about sex? XD
7/9/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: SEX 🤭
7/9/19, 17:11 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
7/9/19, 17:11 - Sara: What do you think about threesomes?
7/9/19, 17:12 - Sara: Uhhh, there is a video about erotic massages 😁
7/9/19, 17:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not particularly interested to be honest
7/9/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: many guys fantasize about it, I guess
7/9/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: but when I think about it I'm a bit scared of it
7/9/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: also, you need to specify the configuration 😋
7/9/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: generally, makes me feel uncomfortable
7/9/19, 17:17 - Sara: Why scared and unconfortable?
7/9/19, 17:17 - Sara: I have said it a lot of times haha
7/9/19, 17:17 - Sara: For me the same, although it has to be interesting to try
7/9/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: If two girls it seems quite challenging for the guy, also have to be careful not to neglect one of the people
7/9/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: and if two guys, similar just more challenging for the girl
7/9/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: and why uncomfortable, I don't know, I guess it would depend on specific people
7/9/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's hard for me to imagine threesome being comfortable for me
7/9/19, 17:20 - Sara: Everybody can neglect everybody, not just the opposite gender
7/9/19, 17:21 - Sara: Maybe the image you are giving about yourself?
7/9/19, 17:21 - Sara: In my case is maybe not being accepted for my body or not knowing what to do or how to satisfy
7/9/19, 17:21 - Sara: If it’s hard with one, imagine with two 😂
7/9/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: pretty much that
7/9/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: also I am not bisexual so it would be kind of awkward for me
7/9/19, 17:22 - Sara: Depending on the configuration again
7/9/19, 17:22 - Sara: Or in what sense?
7/9/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, depending on the configuration
7/9/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: but actually also if the girls start making out then what am I supposed to do, watch?
7/9/19, 17:23 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7/9/19, 17:23 - Sara: I really liked this
7/9/19, 17:23 - Sara: There are techniques
7/9/19, 17:24 - Sara: I have watched some haha
7/9/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am pretty sure that at some point I would start to feel like I'm just in the middle
7/9/19, 17:24 - Sara: It shouldn’t be like that
7/9/19, 17:24 - Sara: There must be always connection between the 3 (4,5,6)
7/9/19, 17:25 - Sara: The third person has to do something also
7/9/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: guitar solo
7/9/19, 17:26 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
7/9/19, 17:26 - Sara: Nah man
7/9/19, 17:26 - Sara: Threesomes are not like in porn xD
7/9/19, 17:27 - Sara: Idk, i would like to know more
7/9/19, 17:27 - Sara: Maybe i don’t do it because of my problems but yeah, it can be fun 😂
7/9/19, 17:29 - Sara: But yeah, wanted to know
7/9/19, 17:29 - Sara: That’s it ☺

7/9/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you are learning, that's very good
7/9/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: education on that topic is not very common, I think
7/9/19, 17:38 - Sara: Thanks 😂
7/9/19, 17:38 - Sara: I hope it is not bad
7/9/19, 17:38 - Sara: Maybe you are misjudging me idk
7/9/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you mean?
7/9/19, 17:39 - Sara: I’m not that kinky
7/9/19, 17:39 - Sara: Or that i prefer lack of empathy or love

7/9/19, 17:40 - Sara: Cannot*
7/9/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: from what I've seen you do not put sex in the first place in your relations with people
7/9/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: and that's how I see it now
7/9/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I think it's good
7/9/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: sex is important but not that important
7/9/19, 17:43 - Sara: Yep
7/9/19, 17:43 - Sara: :)

7/9/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I won't judge you for anything
7/9/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't feel bad about it
7/9/19, 17:46 - Sara: I know
7/9/19, 17:46 - Sara: But puf
7/9/19, 17:48 - Sara: My attempt to be confident went wrong 😂
7/9/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: only people who don't do anything don't make mistakes
7/9/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I think it's fine, really
7/9/19, 17:49 - Sara: Buah xd

7/9/19, 17:50 - Sara: 😂😂😂
7/9/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I can only tell you that for me it doesn't matter 😘
7/9/19, 17:50 - Sara: Yeah i know
7/9/19, 17:50 - Sara: But again
7/9/19, 17:51 - Sara: Then i’m the senseless kinky
7/9/19, 17:51 - Sara: 😂
7/9/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you really think that about yourself...
7/9/19, 17:51 - Sara: Not at all
7/9/19, 17:51 - Sara: It’s the way you see me probably
7/9/19, 17:52 - Sara: You have called me that several times
7/9/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I don't
7/9/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: It seemed sort of funny at the moment but obviously I had to go to far with it
7/9/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry for that
7/9/19, 17:53 - Sara: Please, you’re apologising for everything
7/9/19, 17:53 - Sara: Don’t do that
7/9/19, 17:53 - Sara: It’s okay
7/9/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe I also needed to get to know you a bit more
7/9/19, 17:53 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/9/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since we became a couple I learned more about you, how you really are and I like it
7/9/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never really thought of you as a senseless kinky
7/9/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: but now I'm actually sure of it
7/9/19, 17:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: because I got to know you more
7/9/19, 17:55 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/9/19, 17:55 - Sara: I think the same about you
7/9/19, 17:56 - Sara: Yeah
7/9/19, 17:56 - Sara: Maybe i have a distorted vision of everything
7/9/19, 17:56 - Sara: What is happening to me? 😂😂
7/9/19, 17:57 - Sara: I’m sorry for being an idiot
7/9/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: you're not, it's important to say those things
7/9/19, 17:57 - Sara: Feeling bad all the time?
7/9/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: to me they can seem obvious but not necessarily to you
7/9/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, I mean questions about my opinion of you
7/9/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: so if you have doubts, ask
7/9/19, 17:58 - Sara: Okay
7/9/19, 17:58 - Sara: The sane
7/9/19, 17:58 - Sara: Same
7/9/19, 17:58 - Sara: But again, i think i need my time
7/9/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll be happy to give you my thoughts
7/9/19, 17:58 - Sara: 😁
7/9/19, 17:59 - Sara: You can do the same
7/9/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know
7/9/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: but personally I prefer to do it face to face
7/9/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: or at least by call
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: Seems logic
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: Think the same
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: But puf
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: I’m paying my shit with you
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: Not fair
7/9/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: Mmmm yes
7/9/19, 18:00 - Sara: I’m being an asshole with you
7/9/19, 18:01 - Sara: Or expressing my sadness with you or something
7/9/19, 18:01 - Sara: Or my disconformity
7/9/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, I'm here for you
7/9/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to help
7/9/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure you would do the same for me
7/9/19, 18:02 - Sara: But it’s not fair 😣
7/9/19, 18:03 - Sara: Of course ♥ but it is different
7/9/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's not fair that I don't feel sad now?
7/9/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, thanks Sara
7/9/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
7/9/19, 18:03 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/9/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: You say it's not fair
7/9/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I just don't have that much on my mind right now
7/9/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: so don't worry about it
7/9/19, 18:04 - Sara: :/
7/9/19, 18:04 - Sara: Are you okay?
7/9/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, I'm very careful with my bike
7/9/19, 18:05 - Sara: Kamil... please
7/9/19, 18:05 - Sara: Tell me
7/9/19, 18:05 - Sara: 😞
7/9/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean it, I'm fine
7/9/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: obviously a bit sad because everyone is leaving and I miss you
7/9/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: but there isn't much that I can do about it
7/9/19, 18:06 - Sara: Yeah
7/9/19, 18:07 - Sara: I’m so sorry for that
7/9/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: eh, I knew that it had to happen eventually but it's still hard to see everyone go
7/9/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: and now I have my own countdown as well
7/9/19, 18:08 - Sara: Yeah
7/9/19, 18:08 - Sara: But everything is going to be fine
7/9/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know but I'm just going to miss this life so much
7/9/19, 18:08 - Sara: Me too
7/9/19, 18:08 - Sara: I’m missing it a lot

7/9/19, 19:23 - Sara: Do you care about me?
7/9/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course I do
7/9/19, 19:23 - Sara: I feel alone
7/9/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/9/19, 19:23 - Sara: I don’t feel your support
7/9/19, 19:23 - Sara: I tell you i’m bad and you ignore it
7/9/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm trying to talk to you but you always just brush me off
7/9/19, 19:24 - Sara: Brush off?
7/9/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot help if you don't let me
7/9/19, 19:24 - Sara: I want
7/9/19, 19:24 - Sara: But it’s a waste of time
7/9/19, 19:24 - Sara: A dilemma
7/9/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: then let me
7/9/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: let me care about you
7/9/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I don't consider it a waste of time at all
7/9/19, 19:25 - Sara: I feel fucking useless
7/9/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/9/19, 19:26 - Sara: The only thing i feel like is crying for nothing
7/9/19, 19:26 - Sara: And i’m not alone
7/9/19, 19:26 - Sara: I don’t want people to find it out
7/9/19, 19:26 - Sara: My life is shit
7/9/19, 19:27 - Sara: Even i cannot be in my own room
7/9/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can I call you?
7/9/19, 19:27 - Sara: Don’t feel like
7/9/19, 19:28 - Sara: Everytime i’m sad is when i talk to you
7/9/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: listen, trying to push everyone away and just bottle your feeling so nobody notices won't help
7/9/19, 19:28 - Sara: It’s not fair
7/9/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: please, if you don't feel like talking to me talk to your family at least
7/9/19, 19:29 - Sara: Talking about shit that is not going to be solved does not help
7/9/19, 19:29 - Sara: Family? Nah
7/9/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm here for you, always
7/9/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: not talking about also doesn't work
7/9/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: so maybe give it a shot
7/9/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: please, give me a chance
7/9/19, 19:30 - Sara: I’m giving it
7/9/19, 19:30 - Sara: But not by call
7/9/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, tell me how you feel then
7/9/19, 19:33 - Sara: Horrible, miserable, useless, weak, fat, alone, confused, unable to face the problems and give a try to anything, treated as a shit by people who i thought they cared about me, sensitive
7/9/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: and why do you feel like that, what happened?
7/9/19, 19:34 - Sara: Me coming back
7/9/19, 19:34 - Sara: Stress
7/9/19, 19:34 - Sara: (Mis)interpretations
7/9/19, 19:34 - Sara: Coward people
7/9/19, 19:34 - Sara: Me in a mirror 😂
7/9/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: you are stronger than you think, you managed a whole year abroad on your own, found many new friends, did very well on your exams
7/9/19, 19:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: seen many places, made so many new memories
7/9/19, 19:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: if that's useless and weak than I don't now what is strong
7/9/19, 19:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: most importantly for me, you changed my life for the better
7/9/19, 19:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was miserable and lonely, now I have you and I couldn't ask for more
7/9/19, 19:36 - Sara: Stop exagerating
7/9/19, 19:36 - Sara: Everybody can do that
7/9/19, 19:36 - Sara: I’m a zero
7/9/19, 19:37 - Sara: I want to think that it was the whole erasmus
7/9/19, 19:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: so by that logic, is everybody weak and useless?
7/9/19, 19:37 - Sara: No
7/9/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: true, whole erasmus had it's part in that but to me meeting you was absolutely most important event
7/9/19, 19:38 - Sara: Why me man 😂
7/9/19, 19:38 - Sara: Better people around
7/9/19, 19:39 - Sara: Idk yet why you are with me if i’m crying all the time
7/9/19, 19:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe that's what you think right now, but that's not what I think
7/9/19, 19:39 - Sara: And i’m normal
7/9/19, 19:39 - Sara: You’ll get tired of me
7/9/19, 19:39 - Sara: You insult me and i believe in your words
7/9/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everybody goes through difficult moments and I would be an awful person if I abbandoned people who need help
7/9/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's ok to not be ok
7/9/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to help you because I love you
7/9/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I want to be with you
7/9/19, 19:41 - Sara: But i’m not an attention whore
7/9/19, 19:41 - Sara: I should manage this alone
7/9/19, 19:41 - Sara: As an adult
7/9/19, 19:41 - Sara: You don’t need to help me if you don’t want to
7/9/19, 19:41 - Sara: I’m not an obligation
7/9/19, 19:42 - Sara: Idk why people treat me so bad
7/9/19, 19:42 - Sara: And when people treat me gold i think i don’t deserve it
7/9/19, 19:42 - Sara: Or that they are hiding something
7/9/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you trust me?
7/9/19, 19:44 - Sara: Little by little
7/9/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: good, I know I don't need to but I want to
7/9/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you're worth it
7/9/19, 19:45 - Sara: Sometimes i feel that you can insult me and say what you like as a joke
7/9/19, 19:45 - Sara: That i’m fat, i’m hairy, my hair is horrible, that i’m an idiot and a childish
7/9/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: you are a great person and people see it, you found so many friends in Ghent
7/9/19, 19:46 - Sara: I don’t do anything special
7/9/19, 19:46 - Sara: I’m not special
7/9/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need to value yourself more
7/9/19, 19:46 - Sara: Friends...
7/9/19, 19:46 - Sara: I would do it if i have somethinf to value
7/9/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: you're special to me
7/9/19, 19:46 - Sara: Idk how
7/9/19, 19:47 - Sara: I have been a zero my whole life
7/9/19, 19:47 - Sara: And i try to do things and people will be better
7/9/19, 19:47 - Sara: And i’ll be doing them wrong
7/9/19, 19:47 - Sara: And i won’t try because i feel i cannot do anything
7/9/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: listen, nobody is perfect, don't judge yourself so harshly
7/9/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot really speak for what's going on in Spain but in Ghent people valued you
7/9/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: trust me that you are very likable
7/9/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's great to have you around
7/9/19, 19:49 - Sara: Lies
7/9/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me there is just something missing ever since you left
7/9/19, 19:49 - Sara: And my parents want us to go the shopping centre
7/9/19, 19:49 - Sara: Uf
7/9/19, 19:49 - Sara: 👉🏻👌🏻
7/9/19, 19:50 - Sara: 😂
7/9/19, 19:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: missing when we go out and meet with people
7/9/19, 19:50 - Sara: I miss that also
7/9/19, 19:50 - Sara: But meh
7/9/19, 19:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: level of cute and adorable dropped so much
7/9/19, 19:50 - Sara: 😊
7/9/19, 19:51 - Sara: Sometimes i imagine life without me and it is the same
7/9/19, 19:51 - Sara: People fake that they care about you
7/9/19, 19:51 - Sara: Then they stab you and makes you feel less
7/9/19, 19:51 - Sara: Fuck my ex
7/9/19, 19:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: tell me more
7/9/19, 19:52 - Sara: I think he was ashamed of me in social media
7/9/19, 19:52 - Sara: “No no, when i love someone i don’t need to upload photos of you”
7/9/19, 19:52 - Sara: His instagram is full of her
7/9/19, 19:52 - Sara: “I care about you”
7/9/19, 19:52 - Sara: He does nor talk
7/9/19, 19:53 - Sara: I wish i could tell him i don’t want him in my life
7/9/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: you cannot?
7/9/19, 19:53 - Sara: What is the use of being rude?
7/9/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes just venting anger like that helps
7/9/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: can't promise that it will but maybe it's worth giving a shot
7/9/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: at the very least stop torturing yourself with it
7/9/19, 19:54 - Sara: And spending time on him when he has been ignorif me for months? No thanks
7/9/19, 19:55 - Sara: I would say fuck him
7/9/19, 19:55 - Sara: But he has someone already 🤗
7/9/19, 19:55 - Sara: He hurted me
7/9/19, 19:55 - Sara: He does not deserve my attention
7/9/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: unfollow on instagram, just push him out of your life
7/9/19, 19:55 - Sara: That is coward
7/9/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's the least you can do
7/9/19, 19:56 - Sara: I’m not like him
7/9/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: and what exactly is the use of torturing yourself with that situation?
7/9/19, 19:56 - Sara: I’m not torturing
7/9/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: he didn't appreciate you, why hang on to it
7/9/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes you are, you still allow it to ruin your selfesteem
7/9/19, 19:57 - Sara: I don’t do anything
7/9/19, 19:57 - Sara: Just ignoring him
7/9/19, 19:57 - Sara: Not really
7/9/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: and yet you tell me that his social media is full of pictures now
7/9/19, 19:58 - Sara: But i cannot ignore reality
7/9/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't let one asshole cloud your view of other people
7/9/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course there are many fake people
7/9/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: but there are many who are genuinely great and they deserve a chance
7/9/19, 19:59 - Sara: And i give them the chance
7/9/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, that's great
7/9/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: now stop talking and thinking about your ex
7/9/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: or at least try
7/9/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: you say you don't but you mention him quite often
7/9/19, 20:01 - Sara: But i need to talk shit xd
7/9/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you don't recognize your issues you cannot solve them
7/9/19, 20:02 - Sara: I recognize them
7/9/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: and does it make you feel better?
7/9/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you keep checking up on him?
7/9/19, 20:03 - Sara: Talk about my problems? Yes
7/9/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean talking shit 🙃
7/9/19, 20:04 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 20:04 - Sara: Shit about him
7/9/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: also I don't exactly understand how is unfollowing someone on social media a coward thing to do?
7/9/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's the problem, you say you just ignore but you still cling to that after all
7/9/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: that way he will always be present in your life
7/9/19, 20:05 - Sara: He told me off 😂
7/9/19, 20:06 - Sara: And i was like c:
7/9/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: eeem, what does it mean?
7/9/19, 20:06 - Sara: He said “oh i thought we were okay and you made invisible your instastories”
7/9/19, 20:06 - Sara: When i’m sure he has done the same
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: Because i have to enter in his profile to see everyhing
7/9/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you're clearly not okay so why not just tell him that
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: Fucking hypocrite and lier
7/9/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: and why do you enter in his profile?
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: Always behind him? Fuck him
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: Idk
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: Routine
7/9/19, 20:07 - Sara: At the end i want to know about him
7/9/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/9/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't want to be in his shadow and yet you allow him to influence you so much
7/9/19, 20:08 - Sara: He has been very important for me for a long time
7/9/19, 20:09 - Sara: And i expect that he cares about me
7/9/19, 20:09 - Sara: LIE
7/9/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that
7/9/19, 20:09 - Sara: True, i feel miserable for that
7/9/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: but at some point you have to move on
7/9/19, 20:09 - Sara: Yeah
7/9/19, 20:09 - Sara: But i have to see him in the same friend group
7/9/19, 20:10 - Sara: We are going to do escale room together with some friends
7/9/19, 20:10 - Sara: I’m dying
7/9/19, 20:10 - Sara: He talked to me about the festival
7/9/19, 20:10 - Sara: Recently
7/9/19, 20:10 - Sara: I didn’t feel like answering
7/9/19, 20:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you don't want to have much in common than you have to make it clear
7/9/19, 20:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: you won't feel better if you don't
7/9/19, 20:11 - Sara: But i have to
7/9/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: always just waiting for another bone from him
7/9/19, 20:11 - Sara: Toledo is small
7/9/19, 20:11 - Sara: Most of my friends are his
7/9/19, 20:11 - Sara: Ignoring him is immature
7/9/19, 20:11 - Sara: Because i cannot
7/9/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it's not going to be easy, but can you just treat him like a colleague or something?
7/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: And i’m not him
7/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: Or not treating him
7/9/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: just the minimum to not make it too awkward
7/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: and unfollow, please
7/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: Idk
7/9/19, 20:13 - Sara: I find that useless
7/9/19, 20:13 - Sara: I can just ignore
7/9/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you think that you actually can, than ok
7/9/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: but don't enter the profile and that kind of thing
7/9/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's what really useless
7/9/19, 20:14 - Sara: I’ll try not
7/9/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: promise me
7/9/19, 20:14 - Sara: I don’t like promises
7/9/19, 20:14 - Sara: But i’ll try
7/9/19, 20:14 - Sara: Gosh, i don’t want to be dependent again
7/9/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you refer to me, I don't think you depend on me in any way
7/9/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: emotional support, yes but that works both ways
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: In a relation
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: I had to be always behind him
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: Sometimes yes, idk
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: Btw, i’m in the shopping centre already
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: So i’ll disconnect
7/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: Have fun in the meeting and say hi
7/9/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, we can continue later
7/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: Thanks a lot
7/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: He is saying about meeting
7/9/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't do anything
7/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: Being there
7/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: That’s a lot
7/9/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: you have strength to deal with that yourself
7/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: Idk what to do
7/9/19, 20:18 - Sara: Bye Kamil 💋 te quiero
7/9/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: perhaps you should meet but you would have to be very clear about your feelings
7/9/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: no beating around the bush
7/9/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: but don't really expect anything useful from him
7/9/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: if what you said is true it will probably be just some poor lies
7/9/19, 21:39 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 21:39 - Sara: But maybe i have been harsh with him
7/9/19, 21:39 - Sara: Maybe he is different
7/9/19, 21:40 - Sara: Sara when she is sad:
Buying clothes 👍 
Have her hair cut
7/9/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you really think that?
7/9/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or do you just want to believe that?
7/9/19, 21:40 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 21:40 - Sara: I don’t like having problems with people
7/9/19, 21:41 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/9/19, 21:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: at some point you have to make up your mind
7/9/19, 21:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you just keep going from hating him to saying that maybe he's not so bad you won't get anywhere
7/9/19, 21:42 - Sara: I want to say all this to him
7/9/19, 21:42 - Sara: And i want to hear him
7/9/19, 21:43 - Sara: I don’t like remove people all of a sudden
7/9/19, 21:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: then do that
7/9/19, 21:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: try to find some sort of closure for that chapter
7/9/19, 21:43 - Sara: I’ll make him wait but yes 😎
7/9/19, 21:43 - Sara: #badbitch
7/9/19, 21:43 - Sara: That’s what i need
7/9/19, 21:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's up to you what kind of closure it's going to be but you have to find it
7/9/19, 21:45 - Sara: Any piece of advice?
7/9/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: definitely tell him everything you told me
7/9/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you hide something it won't work
7/9/19, 21:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: considering you have common friends you can try to find some sort of balance
7/9/19, 21:46 - Sara: Yes
7/9/19, 21:46 - Sara: I agree
7/9/19, 21:47 - Sara: Also i want to work with his as musicians

7/10/19, 18:07 - Sara: Doing exercise 😂
7/10/19, 18:08 - Sara: Maybe later
7/10/19, 18:08 - Sara: I feel like exercising
7/10/19, 18:08 - Sara: And being strong 💪
7/10/19, 18:08 - Sara: Or you want to talk now?
7/10/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to see 😊
7/10/19, 18:09 - Sara: Really?

7/10/19, 18:14 - Sara: I should do more arm exercises but i feel weak 😂
7/10/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: What exactly are you doing?
7/10/19, 18:16 - Sara: Because squats, the glute bridge, abs are easy
7/10/19, 18:16 - Sara: Push ups also
7/10/19, 18:16 - Sara: But the pull up stuff...
7/10/19, 18:16 - Sara: Basically that
7/10/19, 18:17 - Sara: I want to work with my whole body and its weight
7/10/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can also do something like that
7/10/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's pretty simple and good for the start
7/10/19, 18:19 - Sara: Buaaah i hate those ones haha
7/10/19, 18:19 - Sara: Strong Kamil
7/10/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buff, I'm getting fat
7/10/19, 18:19 - Sara: I thought about them
7/10/19, 18:19 - Sara: Uf... so fat... definitely
7/10/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to start running again
7/10/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And swimming
7/10/19, 18:20 - Sara: You are not fat at all
7/10/19, 18:20 - Sara: Man please
7/10/19, 18:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:22 - Sara: My leg 😮
7/10/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, you should probably make some sort of plan for these exercises
7/10/19, 18:23 - Sara: Yes...
7/10/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the beginning nothing to difficult
7/10/19, 18:23 - Sara: I need strength in my arma
7/10/19, 18:23 - Sara: Arms*
7/10/19, 18:23 - Sara: Yep
7/10/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: And try to stick to it every day
7/10/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once you get used to that you can make it harder
7/10/19, 18:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: At first probably like 10-15 minutes should be enough
7/10/19, 18:24 - Sara: Yep ♥
7/10/19, 18:24 - Sara: 🥰
7/10/19, 18:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sounds like a good plan
7/10/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most important thing will be to keep doing it every day (well almost)
7/10/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's why at the beginning it's best to not make it to hard
7/10/19, 18:26 - Sara: Understandable
7/10/19, 18:26 - Sara: Now i’m fine
7/10/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good
7/10/19, 18:27 - Sara: I’m sweating already 😂
7/10/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it shouldn't be too easy either
7/10/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's nice
7/10/19, 18:28 - Sara: Yep
7/10/19, 18:28 - Sara: Well, i’m doing more than 60 per exercise
7/10/19, 18:28 - Sara: I’m now establishing the routine haha
7/10/19, 18:29 - Sara: Damn 😭😭😭
7/10/19, 18:29 - Sara: Hahaha
7/10/19, 18:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But 60 with breaks, right?
7/10/19, 18:30 - Sara: In between those 60?
7/10/19, 18:30 - Sara: Or between each exercise?
7/10/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean you should probably do like 15-20 or maybe even 10 reps
7/10/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then maybe 30 seconds break
7/10/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Another exercise
7/10/19, 18:31 - Sara: Depending on the exercise
7/10/19, 18:31 - Sara: But yes, maybe less
7/10/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: And do that kind of cycle a few times
7/10/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: 60 in one go is a lot
7/10/19, 18:32 - Sara: Only once i think
7/10/19, 18:32 - Sara: Yep... that’s impossible
7/10/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: For now you can do once
7/10/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: After some time you can increase
7/10/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't try to completely exhaust yourself
7/10/19, 18:33 - Sara: Why not?
7/10/19, 18:33 - Sara: I’ll stop, i’m tired already
7/10/19, 18:34 - Sara: Almost 30 min is not bad
7/10/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Many people when they first try to start exercising they immediately try to go all out
7/10/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if you're not used to it maybe you will maintain for a few weeks
7/10/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then probably stop
7/10/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's what happens most often
7/10/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: By starting slower you can make a habit out of exercising
7/10/19, 18:35 - Sara: Well, i’m doing them for complement the classes
7/10/19, 18:35 - Sara: As well
7/10/19, 18:35 - Sara: I’m afraid of that
7/10/19, 18:36 - Sara: I would like to go to the gym in august
7/10/19, 18:36 - Sara: But idk
7/10/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:38 - Sara: When it comes to the diet, i think i have the good habit
7/10/19, 18:38 - Sara: But i want changes
7/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: And little by little... maybe they are not that much
7/10/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Diet is an example but same principles apply to all sorts of havits
7/10/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Habits*
7/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: What i want is being able to stand in the american bar
7/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: Well, i can
7/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: But better
7/10/19, 18:40 - Sara: Yep
7/10/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is that?
7/10/19, 18:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, although it seems like a somewhat difficult goal
7/10/19, 18:41 - Sara: Yep
7/10/19, 18:41 - Sara: Requires time
7/10/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should probably set some smaller ones too
7/10/19, 18:41 - Sara: Yes yes
7/10/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ones that you can reach faster
7/10/19, 18:41 - Sara: I know
7/10/19, 18:42 - Sara: The exercises are fine
7/10/19, 18:42 - Sara: Also pole dance itself helps
7/10/19, 18:43 - Sara: These are basically abs haha
7/10/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/10/19, 19:23 - Sara: Spoiler: that’s you :)

7/10/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I didn't expect it in Spanish like that but of course I do 😘
7/10/19, 19:24 - Sara: That’s the spanish way of saying it :p
7/10/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you're not convincing anybody that yellow is great 💛
7/10/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean please

7/12/19, 11:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: alcoholism and sleep depravation
7/12/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: mmmmm perfection 🤗
7/12/19, 12:12 - Sara: Basically 😂
7/12/19, 12:12 - Sara: But are we talking about you now? 🤔
7/12/19, 12:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's really nice that you are picking up from my fabulous example
7/12/19, 12:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you also puke in the shower?
7/12/19, 12:14 - Sara: Not yet
7/12/19, 12:14 - Sara: I’m disappointed ☹
7/12/19, 12:14 - Sara: But i puked pink in a wc
7/12/19, 12:14 - Sara: That’s close
7/12/19, 12:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: pink?
7/12/19, 12:17 - Sara: Wine...
7/12/19, 12:17 - Sara: 😂
7/12/19, 12:17 - Sara: C’mone Kamil i have told you this annecdote xD
7/12/19, 12:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: eeee, I thought you were talking about last night
7/12/19, 12:18 - Sara: Hahaha nah
7/12/19, 12:18 - Sara: I didn’t drink anything
7/12/19, 12:18 - Sara: Just stole some of my friend’s beer
7/12/19, 12:18 - Sara: But mostly water
7/12/19, 12:18 - Sara: So hot 🥵
7/12/19, 12:19 - Sara: Also i didn’t have much money and it’s important to cut down sometimes 😂
7/12/19, 12:19 - Sara: It makes you have more belly i think
7/12/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably, beer has a lot of calories
7/12/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 12:20 - Sara: Not that much, depending on the beer
7/12/19, 12:21 - Sara: Also idk why its gas is accumulated in your belly
7/12/19, 12:21 - Sara: But not fart, i mean 😂
7/12/19, 12:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Beer has CO2 in it
7/12/19, 12:21 - Sara: A guiness is 35 kcal per 100ml
7/12/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you drink it shortly after opening it most of it ends up in your stomach
7/12/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was curious about how can people drink a beer in a few seconds
7/12/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: and one of the tips was to definitely wait until most of the gas is gone
7/12/19, 12:23 - Sara: How much time?
7/12/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: not sure tbh
7/12/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: but these were the tips for fast drinking
7/12/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you drink it normally I think it's not much of a problem
7/12/19, 12:24 - Sara: Why people want to drink it fast?
7/12/19, 12:24 - Sara: For being tipsy?
7/12/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most of the time as a bet or to show off
7/12/19, 12:25 - Sara: Unga unga 😂
7/12/19, 12:25 - Sara: Partly understandable
7/12/19, 12:25 - Sara: But better shots to drink fast
7/12/19, 12:25 - Sara: Misisng our tequila shots 😭
7/12/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/Os12CJONFpo
7/12/19, 12:26 - Sara: Hot girl ugh
7/12/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, first one that showed up
7/12/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Illustrates the point
7/12/19, 12:26 - Sara: But yes, people do that
7/12/19, 12:27 - Sara: Wasting money
7/12/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it's in america then they are probably drinking something very cheap
7/12/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: and very weak
7/12/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: like bud light or something
7/12/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think anybody ever did that with gulden draak
7/12/19, 12:29 - Sara: Imagine 😂
7/12/19, 12:29 - Sara: I would die probably
7/12/19, 12:30 - Sara: I’ll have a shower, do you want video chat later?
7/12/19, 12:30 - Sara: In about 15-20 minutes
7/12/19, 12:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I forgot, you can also bottom of the glass on the table
7/12/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: it also releases the CO2 from the beer

7/12/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure, why not
7/12/19, 12:31 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/12/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: ups, I wnated to write hit the bottom of the glass on the table

7/12/19, 16:31 - Sara: Okay, I have checked about the planes for Berlin
7/12/19, 16:32 - Sara: I have to take the one at 6:25 to go there because it's the most resonable in price and time in compararon with others
7/12/19, 16:32 - Sara: And arrives to SFX
7/12/19, 16:32 - Sara: And then for coming back to Madrid there are two options for the same price and it's in the other one, in TXL
7/12/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: ufff, that's early and far
7/12/19, 16:33 - Sara: one at 7:20 (when you have yours at 6:25) and at 12:25 (when you have at 12:05)
7/12/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess we can spend most of the first day in the apartment 😁
7/12/19, 16:33 - Sara: Early but I have house in Madrid, maybe I can sleep at the airport or take a taxi (and it's only 10 minutes)
7/12/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it works for you, I'm fine with that
7/12/19, 16:34 - Sara: So probably the best option for you it's the last one, right?
7/12/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: for the flight back?
7/12/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: in that case, yes
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: For me, the price is 109 euros so that's quite nice for me
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: For both
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: Well, maybe you can take the one at 9
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: Nop
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: Both the last one
7/12/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: no, ay xD
7/12/19, 16:35 - Sara: I got confused
7/12/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: you get there at 9 so the earlier I arrive, the better
7/12/19, 16:36 - Sara: I would arrive at 9:20
7/12/19, 16:36 - Sara: Yep
7/12/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: okay, that seems reasonable
7/12/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: on monday or tuesday we can book it
7/12/19, 16:37 - Sara: Sorry for making you spend 20 euros more ><
7/12/19, 16:37 - Sara: 👍🏻
7/12/19, 16:37 - Sara: Nice!
7/12/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: not 20 I think
7/12/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: and it's not much anyway
7/12/19, 16:37 - Sara: And I can also ask the guy of the studio in Berlin
7/12/19, 16:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
7/12/19, 16:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: can you send mi the link to that studio?
7/12/19, 16:38 - Sara: 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌😍😍😍😍
7/12/19, 16:38 - Sara: Yep!
7/12/19, 16:38 - Sara: Maybe it's in Spanish

7/12/19, 16:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: second week of october I can probably go to Spain
7/12/19, 16:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: flights look reasonable
7/12/19, 16:49 - Sara: Probably prices will be higher because it's national day
7/12/19, 16:49 - Sara: really?
7/12/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: 87 euro
7/12/19, 16:50 - Sara: Oh... in that case yes

7/12/19, 16:53 - Sara: In november we have
7/12/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw if you check flights between Warsaw and monday remember to pick WMI airport, not WAW
7/12/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: warsaw and madrid*
7/12/19, 16:53 - Sara: 👍🏻
7/12/19, 16:53 - Sara: But both are acceptable right?
7/12/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: from WAW there are only expensive ones and typically not direct
7/12/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: from WMI ryanair flies directly to Madrid
7/12/19, 16:54 - Sara: okay
7/12/19, 16:55 - Sara: but yeah
7/12/19, 16:55 - Sara: first focus on the first one xD
7/12/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me it looks good, now you just need to sort out your studies
7/12/19, 16:56 - Sara: yep
7/12/19, 16:56 - Sara: If i had the schedule I want, tuesday and wednesday will be very busy
7/12/19, 16:56 - Sara: but not thursday and friday
7/12/19, 16:56 - Sara: but yeah, maybe when i do my enrolment and know my schedule we can talk about that
7/12/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: that also but I meant whether you need to retake exam in Ghent or not
7/12/19, 16:57 - Sara: True
7/12/19, 16:58 - Sara: But again, the exam i had to retake in ghent is the 21st august
7/12/19, 16:58 - Sara: It’s my very last option tbh
7/12/19, 16:58 - Sara: I prefer study the spanish course
7/12/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know and I hope they allow you to do that

7/12/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: please
7/12/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's also a form of exercising
7/12/19, 17:03 - Sara: I talk to you later, sorry
7/12/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😭
7/12/19, 17:03 - Sara: I would be embarrased
7/12/19, 17:03 - Sara: 😂
7/12/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/12/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: by now I've seen probably almost everything
7/12/19, 17:04 - Sara: Almost everything?
7/12/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk do you have any secret abillities?
7/12/19, 17:05 - Sara: Being a failure counts? 😂
7/12/19, 17:05 - Sara: Nah, not really
7/12/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I respect anybody who makes an effort to exercise
7/12/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing funny about that
7/12/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: you should be proud, not embarrased
7/12/19, 17:06 - Sara: Thanks
7/12/19, 17:06 - Sara: But why do you want to see me?
7/12/19, 17:06 - Sara: Proud? Well, it’s normal
7/12/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: because I like to see you 🥰
7/12/19, 17:06 - Sara: ♥
7/12/19, 17:07 - Sara: I really appreciate that but i would be distracted
7/12/19, 17:07 - Sara: And feeling observed, idk
7/12/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:08 - Sara: I’m feeling forced :/

7/12/19, 17:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/12/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: like, which exercises and how many reps
7/12/19, 17:10 - Sara: I’m doing it, yes
7/12/19, 17:10 - Sara: I want it to be a routine
7/12/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's good
7/12/19, 17:11 - Sara: I’m weird now, i think i’ll go exercise and talk later
7/12/19, 17:11 - Sara: Around 6 i have to be ready for leaving to Cuenca
7/12/19, 17:11 - Sara: Going to*

7/12/19, 17:24 - Sara: 40 repetitions per activity
7/12/19, 17:25 - Sara: Not bad
7/12/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how many activities?
7/12/19, 17:25 - Sara: Push ups with the other one for arms, abs, glutes and squats
7/12/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You really did 40 push ups?
7/12/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Without breaks?
7/12/19, 17:25 - Sara: So 4
7/12/19, 17:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok
7/12/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought 40 push ups without breaks
7/12/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: That would be very impressive
7/12/19, 17:28 - Sara: Someday 😂
7/12/19, 17:28 - Sara: 😂😂
7/12/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems ok
7/12/19, 17:28 - Sara: Can you do it?
7/12/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
7/12/19, 17:29 - Sara: Impressive
7/12/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: But probably only once
7/12/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then a break
7/12/19, 17:29 - Sara: That’s good
7/12/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not in great shape
7/12/19, 17:29 - Sara: C’mone Kamil
7/12/19, 17:29 - Sara: Don’t deny the obvious
7/12/19, 17:30 - Sara: You are
7/12/19, 17:30 - Sara: And you have a lot of strength
7/12/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: How do you know that?
7/12/19, 17:30 - Sara: Checked
7/12/19, 17:30 - Sara: Hahaha basically
7/12/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤔
7/12/19, 17:31 - Sara: It’s true
7/12/19, 17:31 - Sara: With the machine for the hand
7/12/19, 17:31 - Sara: Or in sex 😂
7/12/19, 17:32 - Sara: And i’m stiff now 😂
7/12/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now go dancing 💃
7/12/19, 17:33 - Sara: I wish
7/12/19, 17:33 - Sara: ☺♥
7/12/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw do you stretch after exercising?
7/12/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because you should
7/12/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: And before too
7/12/19, 17:33 - Sara: Yes, but when i did the exercises on my own i forgot
7/12/19, 17:33 - Sara: Ups...
7/12/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's important because otherwise it's easy to get injured
7/12/19, 17:34 - Sara: in pole dance we do both
7/12/19, 17:34 - Sara: Damn, yesterday class was insane haha
7/12/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's good
7/12/19, 17:34 - Sara: Yep, and a lot
7/12/19, 17:34 - Sara: 30 minutes before and 5 later
7/12/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perfect
7/12/19, 17:35 - Sara: That’s nice for having more flexibility but i’m a stick 😂
7/12/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you stretch everyday, it will improve
7/12/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't take much time
7/12/19, 17:36 - Sara: But it is different from the stretch before/after exercising?
7/12/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean you plan to exercise almost every day
7/12/19, 17:36 - Sara: Me flexible? Impossible 😂
7/12/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: So add stretching to that
7/12/19, 17:36 - Sara: Yep, i can
7/12/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Venga Sara, full split
7/12/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Imagine the possibilities
7/12/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:38 - Sara: I wish 😂
7/12/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:38 - Sara: Maybe i can try
7/12/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's possible for you
7/12/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously it will take some time
7/12/19, 17:39 - Sara: Yep i hope
7/12/19, 17:39 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean you probably already could have done it once
7/12/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: As a child
7/12/19, 17:40 - Sara: Ummm idk if i’m honest
7/12/19, 17:40 - Sara: Probably
7/12/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw good luck in Cuenca 😋
7/12/19, 17:41 - Sara: Thanks 🤗
7/12/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you'll survive
7/12/19, 17:41 - Sara: I’ll see what’s going on haha
7/12/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
7/12/19, 17:42 - Sara: I hope
7/12/19, 17:42 - Sara: Nah, i don’t hate going to cuenca or my family
7/12/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that case, have fun 😊
7/12/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope Paco de la Torre won't dissapoint
7/12/19, 17:43 - Sara: Please
7/12/19, 17:43 - Sara: He is Paco
7/12/19, 17:43 - Sara: He won’t
7/12/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, tell me if there will be any awesome puns or anything of that sort
7/12/19, 17:44 - Sara: Of course haha
7/12/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, "maybe you should polish your nails, daughter"
7/12/19, 17:44 - Sara: I’m afraid
7/12/19, 17:45 - Sara: Nah, in spanish it’s not the same 😂
7/12/19, 17:45 - Sara: But that one is good
7/12/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
7/12/19, 17:45 - Sara: We would say “pulir”
7/12/19, 17:45 - Sara: I think
7/12/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or polish your english
7/12/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any puns with Polaco?
7/12/19, 17:46 - Sara: Puf
7/12/19, 17:46 - Sara: Difficult
7/12/19, 17:46 - Sara: But they are going to go straight to the point
7/12/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't really have the second meaning like in English, right?
7/12/19, 17:46 - Sara: I told you some
7/12/19, 17:47 - Sara: Nop
7/12/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dissapointed
7/12/19, 17:47 - Sara: It’s not a word game but hidden meaning
7/12/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Meh, I know, about exams in Poland
7/12/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not the same
7/12/19, 17:48 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/12/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mentioned something like that, no?
7/12/19, 17:48 - Sara: Nop
7/12/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: About what your father told you?
7/12/19, 17:48 - Sara: About me going to Poland to live or to study
7/12/19, 17:48 - Sara: 😂
7/12/19, 17:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure now, I recalled you telling me something like that but maybe I'm wrong
7/12/19, 17:49 - Sara: Probably
7/12/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I'll check how many push ups I can do in a row
7/12/19, 17:51 - Sara: Okay
7/12/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I actually haven't tried in a long time
7/12/19, 17:51 - Sara: I’ll watch a video about how to produce erections
7/12/19, 17:51 - Sara: Go for it!
7/12/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do they have videos about getting someone wet?
7/12/19, 17:52 - Sara: Masturbation for people with vagina? Obvious
7/12/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: not so obvious
7/12/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: without touching
7/12/19, 17:52 - Sara: Oh
7/12/19, 17:52 - Sara: In that case... i’ll check
7/12/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: you know, I'm just asking
7/12/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: for a friend...
7/12/19, 17:53 - Sara: I have watched some tantra exercise for both being excited
7/12/19, 17:58 - Sara: Btw, do you know what is tantric sex?
7/12/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: not really
7/12/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought about taking a picture for you but I cannot decide how to take it
7/12/19, 18:01 - Sara: However you want ♥ i’ll love it
7/12/19, 18:01 - Sara: I’m sure
7/12/19, 18:01 - Sara: Or if you don’t want, it is also fine
7/12/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do but I'm horrible
7/12/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I'll try
7/12/19, 18:02 - Sara: Horribly awesome 💕
7/12/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:04 - Sara: https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/wellbeing/relationships/tantric-sex-69302
7/12/19, 18:05 - Sara: That's your 'i want to die' face
7/12/19, 18:05 - Sara: Joking, you are quite cute ☺😍🥰
7/12/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's my everyday face
7/12/19, 18:05 - Sara: You smilling is a blessing
7/12/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I do agree with that meaning
7/12/19, 18:05 - Sara: Don't break your face
7/12/19, 18:06 - Sara: you should do also exercise your face muscles
7/12/19, 18:06 - Sara: ;)
7/12/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: or just wear a bag over it
7/12/19, 18:07 - Sara: The world needs to see that precious face ❤
7/12/19, 18:09 - Sara: Really
7/12/19, 18:10 - Sara: I have never understood why you see yourself like that
7/12/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: nah, just you is enough 😘
7/12/19, 18:10 - Sara: ❤
7/12/19, 18:10 - Sara: Also yourself
7/12/19, 18:11 - Sara: :)
7/12/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: unfortunately
7/12/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: others at least have a choice
7/12/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
7/12/19, 18:11 - Sara: :(
7/12/19, 18:11 - Sara: Don't say that
7/12/19, 18:12 - Sara: you are beautiful
7/12/19, 18:12 - Sara: and buttiful
7/12/19, 18:12 - Sara: ❤
7/12/19, 18:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably not the best example 🙃
7/12/19, 18:15 - Sara: Okay
7/12/19, 18:15 - Sara: Show me a good example
7/12/19, 18:15 - Sara: 😊

7/12/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Please, end my suffering"
7/12/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw I sent you a photo topless, so you know...
7/12/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I was even smiling
7/12/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
7/12/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have fun in Cuenca, mi sol ❤
7/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: But
7/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: Cielo
7/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: Are you okay?
7/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: And I really appreciate it
7/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/12/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: How do you say are you okay in Spanish?
7/12/19, 18:32 - Sara: Do you want photos?
7/12/19, 18:32 - Sara: Estás bien?
7/12/19, 18:32 - Sara: Está todo bien?
7/12/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel like, yes
7/12/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like new photos with you 😍
7/12/19, 18:32 - Sara: Okay misiu ☺
7/12/19, 18:33 - Sara: Which ones?
7/12/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any really tbh
7/12/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: If your face isn't behind your phone is quite nice
7/12/19, 18:33 - Sara: Ah! Photos of me?
7/12/19, 18:34 - Sara: I’ll try 🤗
7/12/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, duh
7/12/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: What did you think? 😊
7/12/19, 18:34 - Sara: You liked the most recent photos of us
7/12/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well with you, of you all sorts of photos with high concentration of Sara in them
7/12/19, 18:40 - Sara: 💕
7/12/19, 18:40 - Sara: High concentration? XD
7/12/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:45 - Sara: Because I wear lipstick?
7/12/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, because most of the picture is you 😂
7/12/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only a small part is a wall
7/12/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the sweet spot for the amount of Sara in the picture is probably around 50 to 75%
7/12/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise it's difficult to capture a whole Sara
7/12/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Here for example we see less than 50% of Sara
7/12/19, 18:48 - Sara: How is the whole Sara?
7/12/19, 18:48 - Sara: Sara is a heavy metal girl also
7/12/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: From toes to head
7/12/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's why these pictures are typically a bit heavy
7/12/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's acceptable
7/12/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have wifi
7/12/19, 18:50 - Sara: I’m a mixture
7/12/19, 18:50 - Sara: I’m in the car already
7/12/19, 18:50 - Sara: Wait, you didn’t have?
7/12/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean that big pictures take a lot of data
7/12/19, 18:50 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's better to download them with wifi
7/12/19, 18:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
7/12/19, 18:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: More like 95%
7/12/19, 18:51 - Sara: Why? 😂
7/12/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:52 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:52 - Sara: Man 😂 that’s only the factor for the percentages?
7/12/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: 95% of picture is Sara but the picture contains only about 10% of Sara
7/12/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are two different percentages
7/12/19, 18:53 - Sara: Such a research
7/12/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Trust me, I'm an engineer
7/12/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can do actual measurements
7/12/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm just eyeballing it
7/12/19, 18:54 - Sara: ~ Oh shit, he is an engineer~
7/12/19, 18:54 - Sara: Not exact numbers
7/12/19, 18:54 - Sara: 😂
7/12/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/12/19, 18:55 - Sara: But yeah
7/12/19, 18:55 - Sara: Exactly haha
7/12/19, 18:55 - Sara: I think i’ll have a rest in the car
7/12/19, 18:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, we can talk later if you want
7/12/19, 18:56 - Sara: Do you want to talk about somehing? Estás bien?
7/12/19, 18:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, at the moment I don't have anything in mind
7/12/19, 18:56 - Sara: Idk, i didn’t see you good
7/12/19, 18:57 - Sara: Don’t like your comments about yourself ><
7/12/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm okay
7/12/19, 18:57 - Sara: Sure? I’m here

7/12/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anything else?
7/12/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did Paco dissapoint? 😢
7/12/19, 22:52 - Sara: Nop, it was brief
7/12/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can't believe it

7/13/19, 01:02 - Sara: It was clear, so quite close
7/13/19, 01:02 - Sara: But it’s more about pragmatic
7/13/19, 01:05 - Sara: Do you need something? Has somethinf happened?
7/13/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
7/13/19, 01:06 - Sara: Are you busy? Don’t you want to talk?

7/13/19, 01:07 - Sara: I love thinking that she and her husband will have children
7/13/19, 01:07 - Sara: Idk she is so slim but has a big belly 😍

7/13/19, 01:13 - Sara: I really admire her for looking after my mother and my uncle alone

7/13/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's something
7/13/19, 01:16 - Sara: I could try but first i should be more confident by car
7/13/19, 01:16 - Sara: Also having time 😂
7/13/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Less partying, more abuela 🤶
7/13/19, 01:17 - Sara: Uf, 50/50 😂
7/13/19, 01:17 - Sara: 👵
7/13/19, 01:18 - Sara: How do you get on well with your family in general?
7/13/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rather neutral I would say
7/13/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Never particularly close
7/13/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nobody in my family besides my cousin went to university
7/13/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And most of the time it just feels like we don't have much to talk about
7/13/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe not necessarily because of that
7/13/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe just too many differences in worldview
7/13/19, 01:21 - Sara: All of them are living in your place?
7/13/19, 01:21 - Sara: Not uni gives you topics
7/13/19, 01:21 - Sara: Not only*
7/13/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most of them somewhere in the area
7/13/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I said that's probably not the only reason
7/13/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Different approach, different interests
7/13/19, 01:22 - Sara: Maybe it is because of age?
7/13/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably also
7/13/19, 01:22 - Sara: How old are your cousins?
7/13/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some of them are my age, some are a few years older
7/13/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oldest is above 30
7/13/19, 01:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some are a bit younger
7/13/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some are in primary school now
7/13/19, 01:25 - Sara: Yep, more or less the same as me
7/13/19, 01:25 - Sara: But yeah
7/13/19, 01:25 - Sara: If you don’t spend tine together...
7/13/19, 01:26 - Sara: But with all the people
7/13/19, 01:26 - Sara: Family, friends, couple...
7/13/19, 01:27 - Sara: But yep
7/13/19, 01:27 - Sara: Now my life is mainly in Toledo
7/13/19, 01:28 - Sara: Or used to be
7/13/19, 01:29 - Sara: But yep

7/13/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: what kind of museum?
7/13/19, 12:29 - Sara: Sobre diseño gráfico, creo
7/13/19, 12:29 - Sara: Por esa razón, mi hermana quiere ir
7/13/19, 12:30 - Sara: (I would say “por eso, mi hermana...”)
7/13/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Donde esta este museo?
7/13/19, 12:31 - Sara: En el centro de la ciudad
7/13/19, 12:32 - Sara: In fact, i would say “casco” to refer to the city centre
7/13/19, 12:32 - Sara: El casco histórico
7/13/19, 12:32 - Sara: So you will have cool photos probably
7/13/19, 12:32 - Sara: To make you come soon :3

7/13/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of short but looks really cool 😎
7/13/19, 13:09 - Sara: It has its story
7/13/19, 13:09 - Sara: It used to have a tower
7/13/19, 13:09 - Sara: But it fell, probably as a consequence of the civil war
7/13/19, 13:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/13/19, 13:11 - Sara: In fact, it is one of the first gothic cathedrals in spain
7/13/19, 13:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/13/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lovely desert with nowhere to hide from 40°C
7/13/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🏜️

7/13/19, 13:18 - Sara: Hahahhaa in the museu
7/13/19, 13:18 - Sara: Museum :p
7/13/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: That explains why this desert is looking at me
7/13/19, 13:24 - Sara: Why? XD
7/13/19, 13:24 - Sara: And it’s not a desert
7/13/19, 13:24 - Sara: !!!! Hahhaa

7/13/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not complaining
7/13/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just stating what I've noticed
7/13/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's the only way to survive in Spain 😂
7/13/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/13/19, 16:03 - Sara: Please
7/13/19, 16:03 - Sara: Hahaha

7/13/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I'm involved, never
7/13/19, 16:05 - Sara: You don’t like it at all :p
7/13/19, 16:05 - Sara: How are you? What are you doing?
7/13/19, 16:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine
7/13/19, 16:07 - Sara: Something new?
7/13/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
7/13/19, 16:09 - Sara: Sure?
7/13/19, 16:09 - Sara: Tell me what have you been doing :)
7/13/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing really, I don't feel like doing anything
7/13/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just listening to music
7/13/19, 16:12 - Sara: Oh!
7/13/19, 16:12 - Sara: Which bands, singers?
7/13/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Linkin Park again
7/13/19, 16:12 - Sara: Nice
7/13/19, 16:13 - Sara: Last cd probably?
7/13/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a Spotify playlist
7/13/19, 16:13 - Sara: Nice
7/13/19, 16:15 - Sara: It is curious that you like them
7/13/19, 16:15 - Sara: Hahahha they are kind of hard for you 😂
7/13/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
7/13/19, 16:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: How was the museum?
7/13/19, 16:30 - Sara: Not hard?
7/13/19, 16:30 - Sara: I tell you later, we are about to go back to Toledo
7/13/19, 16:30 - Sara: But yeah, quite nice
7/13/19, 16:30 - Sara: I sent you some photos
7/13/19, 17:14 - Sara: Now i’m in the car 😊
7/13/19, 17:14 - Sara: It was small but effective
7/13/19, 17:14 - Sara: It was about his uses of colours and the logos he designed
7/13/19, 17:15 - Sara: This guy from Cuenca designed logos from the PSOE party, the national post office or for the national police
7/13/19, 17:15 - Sara: Also posters for movies
7/13/19, 17:15 - Sara: And then we have been eating with my family, and nice
7/13/19, 17:16 - Sara: Now coming back to Toledo and going out again
7/13/19, 17:16 - Sara: I feel like going party 🎊
7/13/19, 17:17 - Sara: Also some of my relatives gave me some money
7/13/19, 17:18 - Sara: Basically they have almost paid me the flight tickets 🤗
7/13/19, 17:18 - Sara: Btw, can i ask you something?
7/13/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Go ahead
7/13/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy that you enjoyed the museum 😊
7/13/19, 17:19 - Sara: Well, it’s more about saying hehe
7/13/19, 17:19 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/13/19, 17:20 - Sara: Yeah, when i was telling you about Guada (I prefer avoid saying ex) via Messenger you were a little bit concerned
7/13/19, 17:20 - Sara: I really like talking to you about this process
7/13/19, 17:21 - Sara: But if it is affecting you in a bad way it’s okay to avoid it
7/13/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's fine, I'm not concerned about that
7/13/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can help you with overcoming your problems, I'm happy
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: Really?
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: I saw you sad
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: I can understand it can be weird or unconfortable
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: You can trust me
7/13/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not because of that
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: In both ways
7/13/19, 17:22 - Sara: Why were you sad then?
7/13/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to talk about it
7/13/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least not now
7/13/19, 17:23 - Sara: Okay
7/13/19, 17:23 - Sara: I want to help
7/13/19, 17:23 - Sara: Specially if it is something related to me
7/13/19, 17:23 - Sara: Are you better now?

7/13/19, 17:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>

7/13/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I went to the bathroom
7/13/19, 19:16 - Sara: no problem :D
7/13/19, 19:54 - Sara: If you need a break up it’s okay
7/13/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't, it's not what I meant at all
7/13/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite the contrary
7/13/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I love you and I don't want to lose you
7/13/19, 19:56 - Sara: You can tell me the truth
7/13/19, 19:56 - Sara: It’s okay
7/13/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean it
7/13/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sad about something different, if you want I guess we can discuss it
7/13/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I definitely don't want to lose you
7/13/19, 19:57 - Sara: I don’t want if you don’t want to talk about that
7/13/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to but I didn't want to talk about it before you going out
7/13/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, you want or later?
7/13/19, 20:00 - Sara: When you want
7/13/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're not online
7/13/19, 20:17 - Sara: Puf
7/13/19, 20:17 - Sara: I don’t know what to do
7/13/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💃
7/13/19, 20:17 - Sara: I want to be with you but i don’t to be closed to new experiences
7/13/19, 20:18 - Sara: I don’t want to feel that i’m limited
7/13/19, 20:18 - Sara: Even if i have never the opportunity to have anything with girls
7/13/19, 20:18 - Sara: But i love you Kamil
7/13/19, 20:18 - Sara: I cried thinking you wanted to break up with me so imagine
7/13/19, 20:19 - Sara: I lived this experience before, and it wasn’t the best ending
7/13/19, 20:19 - Sara: Neither i want you to be sad or feeling unconfortable, it’s not fair
7/13/19, 20:20 - Sara: I would say we can wait until it happens but...
7/13/19, 20:20 - Sara: In the past I was like that for 1 year or even more
7/13/19, 20:22 - Sara: Honestly, i don’t know what to do
7/13/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Think about it and then tell me
7/13/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any decision you make, it's going to be ok
7/13/19, 20:23 - Sara: Why me?
7/13/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you how I feel
7/13/19, 20:23 - Sara: Why not us?
7/13/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot make decisions about you
7/13/19, 20:23 - Sara: Me neither about you
7/13/19, 20:23 - Sara: I don’t want to have the weight of this.. again
7/13/19, 20:24 - Sara: It is always that i should be the one adapting or deciding
7/13/19, 20:24 - Sara: Why don’t you want to help me?
7/13/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: How can I help you with this?
7/13/19, 20:25 - Sara: In deciding what to do
7/13/19, 20:25 - Sara: As a couple, obviously
7/13/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: But what can I tell you?
7/13/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to be with you but if it's going to make you unhappy then I will gladly sacrifice my happiness
7/13/19, 20:27 - Sara: Gladly...
7/13/19, 20:27 - Sara: Don’t be a victim or a martyr
7/13/19, 20:28 - Sara: I’m afraid of repeting the mistakes i had in the past
7/13/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I'm sorry that I'm like this
7/13/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how to handle this
7/13/19, 20:29 - Sara: I’ll think about this
7/13/19, 20:29 - Sara: Love you 💋

7/14/19, 15:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, man (puts hand on your shoulder)
7/14/19, 15:36 - Sara: 😂

7/14/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm disappointed
7/14/19, 18:10 - Sara: Why?
7/14/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I found a website with Spanish diminutives for names
7/14/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's called diminutives or something like that
7/14/19, 18:10 - Sara: Yep
7/14/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And there is nothing for Sara
7/14/19, 18:10 - Sara: Surprise me
7/14/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ana Lucía becomes Analú and I find it kind of funny
7/14/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dolores is Lola
7/14/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Carmen is Menchu, I have no clue why
7/14/19, 18:12 - Sara: Sometimes we can say Carmenchu
7/14/19, 18:12 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1Ep9V-SDXA
7/14/19, 18:13 - Sara: Sarita
7/14/19, 18:13 - Sara: but it's not a long name
7/14/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought about this before
7/14/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's not very satisfying
7/14/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I'll stay with Sariño
7/14/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe Sariña
7/14/19, 18:14 - Sara: You can invent one
7/14/19, 18:14 - Sara: Also I like it :)
7/14/19, 18:14 - Sara: So studying spanish?
7/14/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit, yes
7/14/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: New tense
7/14/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretérito perfecto
7/14/19, 18:15 - Sara: simple o compuesto?
7/14/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: IIII don't know 😅
7/14/19, 18:16 - Sara: tell me an example :)
7/14/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: He quedado con mis amigos.
7/14/19, 18:16 - Sara: compuesto then :)
7/14/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is simple
7/14/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: quedé con mis amigos
7/14/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah ok
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: wait
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: i think
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: xD
7/14/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: They called it pretérito indefinido
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: Yep
7/14/19, 18:17 - Sara: Never heard that in my life
7/14/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I suppose it's the equivalent of past simple
7/14/19, 18:18 - Sara: but yeah, if it is the same it's okay aha
7/14/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it kind of makes sense to not name it perfecto
7/14/19, 18:18 - Sara: btw, i have been listening this song recently and i have thinking that you may like it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjseUt1is-o

7/14/19, 18:21 - Sara: Quite nice
7/14/19, 18:21 - Sara: But it's a very sad song
7/14/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: On the Spanish Playlist there is one band that surprised me a little
7/14/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's called dover
7/14/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: they sing in English
7/14/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But they are actually spanish

7/14/19, 23:24 - Sara: One of my favourite places
7/14/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: It seems pretty high

7/14/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is it going?

7/15/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to go to uni tomorrow so I'll probably go to sleep soon
7/15/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: The sounds that this rabbit makes at the end remind me of something

7/15/19, 01:10 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/15/19, 01:10 - Sara: Gosh i really love this gif
7/15/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again? ok on my way to eat you
7/15/19, 01:11 - Sara: I wish
7/15/19, 01:11 - Sara: How are you?
7/15/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I intended to go to sleep but I started watching a video about tenses in spanish
7/15/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to have at least a general overview of all of them
7/15/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, most important ones at least
7/15/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: How about you?
7/15/19, 01:12 - Sara: Which ones do you know already?
7/15/19, 01:12 - Sara: It was nice ☺
7/15/19, 01:13 - Sara: We have been having dinner in the shopping centre and then having a walk
7/15/19, 01:13 - Sara: And being in the valley
7/15/19, 01:13 - Sara: I’m better, we have been talking a bit about my case with my ex
7/15/19, 01:14 - Sara: I didn’t know how much toxic it was
7/15/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
7/15/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want, of course
7/15/19, 01:14 - Sara: Well, it is not that much
7/15/19, 01:15 - Sara: Just that Christian realized the behaviours Guada had towards me in a relationship
7/15/19, 01:15 - Sara: For a long time
7/15/19, 01:15 - Sara: And he said i didn’t deserve it
7/15/19, 01:15 - Sara: He wants to teach me how to be more selfish 😂
7/15/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not a bad idea 😊
7/15/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I agree with him
7/15/19, 01:16 - Sara: It is hard 😂
7/15/19, 01:16 - Sara: Idk, it was our first relationship
7/15/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I mean not completely selfish I suppose
7/15/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a healthy amount
7/15/19, 01:17 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 01:17 - Sara: Obvious haha
7/15/19, 01:17 - Sara: Think more about myself
7/15/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely a good idea
7/15/19, 01:18 - Sara: But it is hard
7/15/19, 01:18 - Sara: I like spending time with people
7/15/19, 01:18 - Sara: Help them when they need it
7/15/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But do you really think that thinking more about yourself prevents you from doing that?
7/15/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like many other things it's about finding the right balance
7/15/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I agree that it's definitely not easy
7/15/19, 01:20 - Sara: It can suppose going out less
7/15/19, 01:20 - Sara: Not at all
7/15/19, 01:20 - Sara: I’ll see
7/15/19, 01:21 - Sara: Still watching the video?
7/15/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Finished
7/15/19, 01:21 - Sara: Was it good?
7/15/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just an overview
7/15/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: How to conjugate and some examples
7/15/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: With many tenses I will have to read much more when to use them correctly
7/15/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still have some problems with it even in English
7/15/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I guess it's about time to fix that
7/15/19, 01:24 - Sara: Yes
7/15/19, 01:25 - Sara: For me it is the same
7/15/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah at this point I just kind of use them without thinking much, hopefully correctly most of the time
7/15/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Going to sleep?
7/15/19, 01:30 - Sara: Oh, i’m at home
7/15/19, 01:30 - Sara: Talking with my sister a big
7/15/19, 01:30 - Sara: Bit
7/15/19, 01:30 - Sara: Not yet
7/15/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to talk about something also, we can
7/15/19, 01:31 - Sara: The same
7/15/19, 01:31 - Sara: I’ll be here
7/15/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, tell me when you're free
7/15/19, 01:38 - Sara: Okay
7/15/19, 01:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/15/19, 01:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can I call you or just texts?
7/15/19, 01:55 - Sara: I would prefer texting
7/15/19, 01:55 - Sara: I’m not alone in the room
7/15/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
7/15/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want to talk about something specific?
7/15/19, 01:56 - Sara: It’s okay, i’m okay ☺
7/15/19, 01:56 - Sara: Do you?
7/15/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much has changed in my life in this last few hours 😁
7/15/19, 01:57 - Sara: Neither
7/15/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: So yeah, I'm still rather fine
7/15/19, 01:57 - Sara: Hahaha
7/15/19, 01:57 - Sara: That’s makes me happy
7/15/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy that you have someone to talk about your problems
7/15/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Someone who knows the situation better
7/15/19, 01:58 - Sara: Yes, i have people around that are a blessing
7/15/19, 01:58 - Sara: Do you think you cannot talk because you don’t know?
7/15/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can and I try but someone who knew what was going on before Erasmus can probably give you better insight
7/15/19, 01:59 - Sara: (Btw, i have just read that i can have an orgasm in 2 minutes with the satisyer omg)
7/15/19, 01:59 - Sara: It is also acceptable
7/15/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's fast
7/15/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Damn
7/15/19, 01:59 - Sara: But you help me go though also, don’t feel excluded ♥
7/15/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Technology will leave me jobless
7/15/19, 01:59 - Sara: Yass
7/15/19, 02:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/15/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I never got to know the married woman Sara 😂
7/15/19, 02:00 - Sara: Gosh, every time is a good excuse
7/15/19, 02:00 - Sara: To use the gif
7/15/19, 02:00 - Sara: Do you hace curiosity?
7/15/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Actually a bit, yes
7/15/19, 02:02 - Sara: Mmmmm
7/15/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But we don't need to talk about it
7/15/19, 02:02 - Sara: I have been the same
7/15/19, 02:02 - Sara: Maybe more dependent on answering
7/15/19, 02:03 - Sara: Okay, don’t worry
7/15/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw you are so thirsty for that, amazing 💕
7/15/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Somewhat reminds me of Andraž, again 😂
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: It is a very funny and cute gif
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: And it expresses a lot
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: But again
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: Don’t think i’m only thinking about that
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: In fact, i prefer other stuff than oral sex
7/15/19, 02:04 - Sara: (Maybe i’ll regret this comment soon)
7/15/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which feelings does it express?
7/15/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: (Kamil will remember that)
7/15/19, 02:05 - Sara: (Kamil taking notes about eatinf pussy better)
7/15/19, 02:05 - Sara: Mmmmm not feelings but maybe me being naughty or teasing you :p
7/15/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy mal Sari
7/15/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why should I even tire my mouth anymore
7/15/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will use your satisfyer
7/15/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😈

7/15/19, 02:07 - Sara: (Sari will remember this)
7/15/19, 02:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I want you to finish many times...
7/15/19, 02:07 - Sara: 😱😱
7/15/19, 02:07 - Sara: Sex marathon

7/15/19, 18:04 - Sara: She recommended waiting for next week
7/15/19, 18:05 - Sara: Just in case, because we don’t have clue when or if there will be even surgery
7/15/19, 18:05 - Sara: I told my mother you were my couple and she was like “why did not you say it on live?” And i was like ?
7/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: At least i told i have a couple
7/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: I have never said i was dating Guada 😂
7/15/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you mean on live?
7/15/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: online?
7/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Face to face?
7/15/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: ah, ok
7/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: But i have commented it indirectly
7/15/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I suppose that's progress 😂
7/15/19, 18:07 - Sara: Maybe my father predicted it but not my mother 😂
7/15/19, 18:07 - Sara: I’m feeling a little bit bad
7/15/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was talking with my mother today and something interesting came up, I'll tell you later
7/15/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: when you return
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Uyyyy
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Why not now?
7/15/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's a bit funny
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: I’m afraid hahaha
7/15/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I don't feel like writing everything
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Okay
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Audio also
7/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: But whatever you feel like ^^

7/15/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: nah, I just like talking with you
7/15/19, 18:09 - Sara: Simultaneously?
7/15/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: eh?
7/15/19, 18:10 - Sara: Talking with me simultaneously
7/15/19, 18:10 - Sara: Like one ask, another answer
7/15/19, 18:10 - Sara: Not audio-audio-audio
7/15/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: ah, yes
7/15/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: phone call, video call
7/15/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: or face to face
7/15/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: last one is definitely a preferred option
7/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: Of course
7/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: The same :)
7/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: Have i been rude with my mother?
7/15/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think so
7/15/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: but maybe she felt like that a bit
7/15/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: hard to tell for me
7/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: :(
7/15/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: nah, I'm sure it's no big deal
7/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: I hope
7/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: I’m this kind of people that thinks i’m hurting everyone without knowing it
7/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: I like being direct but..
7/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: Fuck
7/15/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you do
7/15/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, people are really not that fragile
7/15/19, 18:14 - Sara: Probably i am
7/15/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry about it too much
7/15/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you hurt people
7/15/19, 18:15 - Sara: I’ll try but you know me
7/15/19, 18:15 - Sara: I hurted Cris
7/15/19, 18:15 - Sara: And i’m sure more people
7/15/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: we all make mistakes
7/15/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: especially in completely new situations
7/15/19, 18:15 - Sara: Yep, probably
7/15/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: you told me not to torture myself with my mistakes and I'm going to ask you to do the same
7/15/19, 18:16 - Sara: It’s different
7/15/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: true, mine are worse
7/15/19, 18:16 - Sara: Not at all
7/15/19, 18:17 - Sara: I don’t want to hurt people i care
7/15/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: nobody does, unless they are really shitty people
7/15/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it sometimes happens anyway
7/15/19, 18:17 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: Do you have this feeling of people having expectations about you?
7/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: Probably if i’m brute or bad is worse
7/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: It’s natural
7/15/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: exactly, so don't feel to bad about it
7/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: (If i don’t answer is because i’ll be running to get the bus)
7/15/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: just try to learn from the mistakes
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: But there is one stop left so it’s okay
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: I try
7/15/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's all
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: I don’t know
7/15/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: and nobody should ask you for more
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: I don’t want to be a bad (insert kinship term here)
7/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: Why not?
7/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, mistakes happen and expecting that someone won't make them is rubbish
7/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: unless you're a robot or something
7/15/19, 18:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: and really, not telling your mother about me before is not really a crime
7/15/19, 18:24 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 18:24 - Sara: But they can hurt us
7/15/19, 18:24 - Sara: And we forget
7/15/19, 18:25 - Sara: Maybe it is more about telling her by telephone
7/15/19, 18:25 - Sara: But my father was doing jokes about Poland
7/15/19, 18:25 - Sara: Also photos, the comments in april
7/15/19, 18:25 - Sara: Idk
7/15/19, 18:25 - Sara: Maybe i misunderstood
7/15/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I assumed that she probably knew
7/15/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I think you did too
7/15/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: So don't worry
7/15/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a misunderstanding
7/15/19, 18:26 - Sara: Okay
7/15/19, 18:26 - Sara: I’ll tell them in person when they come
7/15/19, 18:26 - Sara: Btw, i also hope the flights don’t get more expensive because of me
7/15/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, your health is more important
7/15/19, 18:27 - Sara: Thanks amor
7/15/19, 18:27 - Sara: But it is true i want to make sure
7/15/19, 18:27 - Sara: Be*
7/15/19, 18:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You will know something more next week?
7/15/19, 18:30 - Sara: I hope
7/15/19, 18:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
7/15/19, 18:30 - Sara: I’ll try to know asap
7/15/19, 18:30 - Sara: But it is not something 100% my choice
7/15/19, 18:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Take as much time as necessary
7/15/19, 18:31 - Sara: Do you think i should ask more photos of the apartment?
7/15/19, 18:31 - Sara: Thanks 💜
7/15/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, why not
7/15/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I saw that it's possible to cancel it
7/15/19, 18:32 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: So maybe we could book it now, idk
7/15/19, 18:32 - Sara: But just ask
7/15/19, 18:32 - Sara: I’ll see as well
7/15/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup

7/15/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: while I'm waiting for you to return home I need something to entertain myself
7/15/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: have you thought about your video?
7/15/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😘
7/15/19, 18:41 - Sara: Do you really want it?
7/15/19, 18:41 - Sara: Kamil
7/15/19, 18:41 - Sara: I think i had multiple orgasms 😂

7/15/19, 18:41 - Sara: Yep
7/15/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I definitely want to see it
7/15/19, 18:43 - Sara: But
7/15/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought it would be quite clear for you to know how many you had
7/15/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: then again I have no clue how it feels
7/15/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: jealous
7/15/19, 18:43 - Sara: Why do you want to watch it?
7/15/19, 18:43 - Sara: It is not really
7/15/19, 18:44 - Sara: Mmmm i’ll explain it in an audio later
7/15/19, 18:44 - Sara: Or if we call later
7/15/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, perfect
7/15/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: although I don't think that words can do it justice 😏
7/15/19, 18:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, I really like to see you enjoy and after everything that you told I'm also very curious
7/15/19, 18:46 - Sara: 🌚
7/15/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought so xd
7/15/19, 18:46 - Sara: Yep, i understand you
7/15/19, 18:46 - Sara: But the video is ridiculous
7/15/19, 18:47 - Sara: Also it’s not that much if we compare when i’m with you
7/15/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, problem is you are not with me right now 😢
7/15/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: but hopefully soon 🤗
7/15/19, 18:48 - Sara: ❤💕
7/15/19, 18:49 - Sara: So idk, i feel weird when you ask me a lot of times
7/15/19, 18:49 - Sara: A no is a no
7/15/19, 18:49 - Sara: Maybe i’ll change my mind soon but that’s on my own, not when you ask me the 10th time
7/15/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, I'm sorry that I pushed you
7/15/19, 18:50 - Sara: Thanks for understanding it
7/15/19, 18:50 - Sara: I don’t want facebook having my video 😂
7/15/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: fair point 😂
7/15/19, 18:51 - Sara: And idk
7/15/19, 18:51 - Sara: It is also me exposing me as an entertain
7/15/19, 18:51 - Sara: I don’t like that
7/15/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: that wasn't the best choice of words by me, sorry
7/15/19, 18:52 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/15/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't consider you that, I hope you know that
7/15/19, 18:53 - Sara: Yes, i know
7/15/19, 18:53 - Sara: But you so interested in me masturbating... idk, first time
7/15/19, 18:54 - Sara: I want to be values for more than that
7/15/19, 18:54 - Sara: Valued*
7/15/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I value you for so much more
7/15/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that many times and I will keep repeating in every day
7/15/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: *that
7/15/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: in this case, idk
7/15/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: you were mentioning that satisfyer quite often
7/15/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I got too excited at some point, sorry
7/15/19, 18:56 - Sara: Excited at what point?
7/15/19, 18:56 - Sara: What type of excitement? 😂
7/15/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, you seemed quite excited about finally getting it
7/15/19, 18:57 - Sara: And I am :)
7/15/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, I guess I just wanted to be a bit more involved in this, rather than just hear about it from your texts, idk
7/15/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: a bit weird, sorry
7/15/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just like seeing you happy 😚
7/15/19, 19:03 - Sara: I know it :)
7/15/19, 19:03 - Sara: Don’t apologize for wanting to be part
7/15/19, 19:03 - Sara: But please, value and have in mind my decision when i say no
7/15/19, 19:04 - Sara: The same as with the exercise
7/15/19, 19:04 - Sara: Makes me feel that i have to do it
7/15/19, 19:04 - Sara: And guilty in some way when i should not be like that
7/15/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, of course
7/15/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: definitely don't feel guilty for any of that
7/15/19, 19:05 - Sara: Thanks
7/15/19, 19:05 - Sara: It is like you don’t take seriously my choice
7/15/19, 19:05 - Sara: Or that i’m doing it wrong
7/15/19, 19:05 - Sara: 😕
7/15/19, 19:07 - Sara: I want you to understand it
7/15/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: when are you going to arrive, more or less?
7/15/19, 19:07 - Sara: That i really appreciate it
7/15/19, 19:07 - Sara: Toledo? In 10 minutes
7/15/19, 19:07 - Sara: Home in 15
7/15/19, 19:08 - Sara: That is the reason why i send you many photos of the places i have been
7/15/19, 19:08 - Sara: Or songs that i’m listening to
7/15/19, 19:08 - Sara: I feel closer to you, i want you to feel me and know me better
7/15/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know and I'm very happy for that
7/15/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still miss you very much
7/15/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: but with all of that it's a bit easier
7/15/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😊
7/15/19, 19:09 - Sara: I miss you too :)
7/15/19, 19:10 - Sara: The same
7/15/19, 19:10 - Sara: But in some topics i need more time
7/15/19, 19:10 - Sara: Or i don’t like it
7/15/19, 19:11 - Sara: https://youtu.be/4q9UafsiQ6k  ♥
7/15/19, 19:11 - Sara: I hope you understand it
7/15/19, 19:11 - Sara: Is it related to my body? Probably it is more about being embarrased of my faces or my movements
7/15/19, 19:11 - Sara: Maybe it’s more about the way you see me
7/15/19, 19:11 - Sara: You know?
7/15/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: The way I see you you're beatiful
7/15/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope to convince you about it at some point
7/15/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: beautiful in more than just body
7/15/19, 19:12 - Sara: I know that i can be beautiful
7/15/19, 19:12 - Sara: ❤ you are a peace of heaven, really
7/15/19, 19:13 - Sara: But again, don’t make me feel threatened for not doing something
7/15/19, 19:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course
7/15/19, 19:13 - Sara: 😭💕
7/15/19, 19:14 - Sara: I want you to see yourself with the same eyes as mine
7/15/19, 19:14 - Sara: ❤💕
7/15/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: The physical looks brought us together in the first place but it was the soul that made me stay
7/15/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope it's similar for you
7/15/19, 19:15 - Sara: It’s not similar
7/15/19, 19:15 - Sara: It’s the same :)
7/15/19, 19:15 - Sara: I’ll arrive soon
7/15/19, 19:15 - Sara: But there are friends in my house
7/15/19, 19:16 - Sara: So idk what to do haha
7/15/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: take your time
7/15/19, 19:16 - Sara: It’s not about running away from them haha

7/15/19, 21:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/15/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
7/15/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are such drastic measures really necessary?
7/15/19, 22:05 - Sara: I don’t see myseld good now
7/15/19, 22:05 - Sara: I want a physical change
7/15/19, 22:05 - Sara: Well, a change in general

7/15/19, 22:06 - Sara: I’m tired
7/15/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: so no talking?
7/15/19, 22:06 - Sara: Probably later
7/15/19, 22:06 - Sara: Now i’m feeling it’s my sister’s plan

7/16/19, 02:10 - Sara: I really liked my sister’s comment
7/16/19, 02:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/16/19, 02:10 - Sara: She said that at first time you look kind of sweet
7/16/19, 02:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean your friends have no clue who I am
7/16/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only at first time?
7/16/19, 02:11 - Sara: First sight?
7/16/19, 02:11 - Sara: “If he makes you happy...” 😊
7/16/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough 😁

7/16/19, 02:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/16/19, 02:14 - Sara: How is it going? What are you doing?
7/16/19, 02:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was trying to go to sleep but it's a bit difficult
7/16/19, 02:15 - Sara: Why?
7/16/19, 02:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, lately I have a bit of a problem with that
7/16/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I was reading stuff
7/16/19, 02:16 - Sara: Something in your mind?
7/16/19, 02:16 - Sara: About what?
7/16/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Gadgets for long distance relationships for example
7/16/19, 02:16 - Sara: Really?
7/16/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are some pretty cool ones
7/16/19, 02:16 - Sara: Interest in sex toys 😍😍😍
7/16/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't mean the sex toys
7/16/19, 02:16 - Sara: DIME MAAAAAS
7/16/19, 02:17 - Sara: oh
7/16/19, 02:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the sex toys are actually very nice but maybe for later
7/16/19, 02:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: They cost a small fortune 😂
7/16/19, 02:17 - Sara: So?
7/16/19, 02:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I kinda like wristbands that transmit touch for example
7/16/19, 02:18 - Sara: Damn
7/16/19, 02:18 - Sara: Send me that :)
7/16/19, 02:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is also one to transfer kisses
7/16/19, 02:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's horrible 😂
7/16/19, 02:18 - Sara: I think i have seen it
7/16/19, 02:19 - Sara: Where are you seeing them?
7/16/19, 02:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://longdistancefun.com/awesome-crazy-gadgets-long-distance-relationship/
7/16/19, 02:20 - Sara: I have just scan it and wow
7/16/19, 02:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some are weird but a few are nice
7/16/19, 02:22 - Sara: Which ones do you like?
7/16/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: The bracelets seem nice
7/16/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But right now it seems that they are not available
7/16/19, 02:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: The sex toys are obviously quite nice
7/16/19, 02:24 - Sara: :(
7/16/19, 02:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: The apps for couples also make sense
7/16/19, 02:24 - Sara: Always
7/16/19, 02:24 - Sara: What does it have?
7/16/19, 02:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: The rest is weird or doesn't work very well
7/16/19, 02:25 - Sara: Maybe it’s more about organization
7/16/19, 02:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the article they said that it's sort of like facebook
7/16/19, 02:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But only for the two of us
7/16/19, 02:25 - Sara: I’ll try to look for it
7/16/19, 02:25 - Sara: Oh
7/16/19, 02:25 - Sara: But we talk or share stuff in wha
7/16/19, 02:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I know
7/16/19, 02:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess for some people it's not enough
7/16/19, 02:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, haven't looked at it closely
7/16/19, 02:26 - Sara: Yep
7/16/19, 02:27 - Sara: Do you see we are dealing the distance relationship well?
7/16/19, 02:27 - Sara: I mean, what you think
7/16/19, 02:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: So far seems good, I obviously miss the physical contact a lot but the communication has been good, sharing everyday stuff is nice
7/16/19, 02:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I just want to hug you so much 😢
7/16/19, 02:30 - Sara: Think the same
7/16/19, 02:30 - Sara: I think that physical contact can motivate us
7/16/19, 02:31 - Sara: Like a battery being complete
7/16/19, 02:31 - Sara: :)
7/16/19, 02:32 - Sara: Love you
7/16/19, 02:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

7/16/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you kill anybody in the game?
7/16/19, 02:35 - Sara: Of course
7/16/19, 02:35 - Sara: No other choice 😂
7/16/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can I ask who? 😊
7/16/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, who suggested me?
7/16/19, 02:35 - Sara: You don’t know them
7/16/19, 02:36 - Sara: My friends 😂
7/16/19, 02:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everybody knows me already? 🤣
7/16/19, 02:36 - Sara: It seems so 😂
7/16/19, 02:36 - Sara: Sooorry
7/16/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool, I will become an urban legend in Toledo
7/16/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't mind 😊
7/16/19, 02:37 - Sara: Not yet
7/16/19, 02:37 - Sara: Sometimes they ask me about you
7/16/19, 02:37 - Sara: Because they know i was sad
7/16/19, 02:38 - Sara: So they follow more or less
7/16/19, 02:38 - Sara: (Some friends from the same group(
7/16/19, 02:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough 😋
7/16/19, 02:38 - Sara: Yep
7/16/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: So they chose to fuck with me, right?
7/16/19, 02:39 - Sara: Yep
7/16/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you at least show them a picture?
7/16/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
7/16/19, 02:39 - Sara: They have seen you
7/16/19, 02:39 - Sara: I didn’t need to haha
7/16/19, 02:39 - Sara: And my sister has seen you already
7/16/19, 02:40 - Sara: The friend you saw in Paris said to them you were attractive
7/16/19, 02:40 - Sara: So 😍🌚
7/16/19, 02:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/16/19, 02:41 - Sara: He is quite straight so yeah, it has merit
7/16/19, 02:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I respect an honest, objective opinion 😂
7/16/19, 02:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yours for example, not at all because you are super biased now
7/16/19, 02:42 - Sara: Not mine 😂
7/16/19, 02:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂😂😂
7/16/19, 02:42 - Sara: Do you think it is subjective?
7/16/19, 02:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Attractiveness? Definitely
7/16/19, 02:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Different people like different things
7/16/19, 02:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: So for someone you can be smoking hot and for someone else just meh
7/16/19, 02:44 - Sara: Understandable
7/16/19, 02:44 - Sara: But that think killed me in my previous relationship, and i don’t want it to happen to you or to me
7/16/19, 02:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
7/16/19, 02:45 - Sara: I could not believe Guada when he made compliments or he helped me when i was bad
7/16/19, 02:45 - Sara: “You only say/do that because you are my couple”
7/16/19, 02:46 - Sara: I’m trying to change that
7/16/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand
7/16/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw I was joking before
7/16/19, 02:46 - Sara: When exactly?
7/16/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do believe you when you tell me compliments
7/16/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's actually quite pleasant 😊

7/16/19, 02:48 - Sara: I’m trying to remove this idea from my head
7/16/19, 02:49 - Sara: Also i shoukd improve my self esteem
7/16/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: When I told you that I had some of the best moments of my life with you I was very serious
7/16/19, 02:49 - Sara: And i keep this video not only in my phone but in my heart and my mind
7/16/19, 02:49 - Sara: I cannot believe i can be such an influence to someone
7/16/19, 02:50 - Sara: And i really feel precious and valorated
7/16/19, 02:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never expected that someone could mean so much to me but you proved me wrong 😍
7/16/19, 02:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm very happy for that

7/16/19, 02:59 - Sara: If you see me what would you do?
7/16/19, 03:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lose consciousness because that would mean that you're a 👻
7/16/19, 03:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/16/19, 03:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I would hug you and I wouldn't let go

7/16/19, 14:16 - Sara: I was worried because i’m tired and the last part was the reading
7/16/19, 14:16 - Sara: What did you improve?

7/16/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I improved my speaking a lot
7/16/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that's not on the test
7/16/19, 14:18 - Sara: The same ^^
7/16/19, 14:18 - Sara: Maybe not the speaking itself
7/16/19, 14:18 - Sara: But my confidence in doing it

7/16/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I hope that they still look at the group
7/16/19, 14:33 - Sara: of course
7/16/19, 14:34 - Sara: but i don't want to annoy

7/16/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, we haven;t mentioned it yet in the group
7/16/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: so it's not really insisting

7/16/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: but just now, please
7/16/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing annoying
7/16/19, 14:37 - Sara: Hahahaha
7/16/19, 14:37 - Sara: I’ll say it
7/16/19, 14:37 - Sara: Idk if in the group or individually
7/16/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if everyone still checks the group
7/16/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Angelo took some photos and I don't think he does, for example
7/16/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: but he was going on a road trip with Sofia so he might be busy
7/16/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: but asking won't hurt
7/16/19, 14:39 - Sara: The whole month?
7/16/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, from what I heard his car wasn't very reliable 😂😂😂
7/16/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the group you can check who saw your messages
7/16/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: just check for something you wrote a few days ago or something like that

7/16/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to travel a bit more to see what I really like
7/16/19, 16:25 - Sara: In which sense?
7/16/19, 16:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: now, I'm not sure what kind of house I would really like
7/16/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: if I see more, visit more maybe it will be easier to pick something
7/16/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: right now my favorite accommodation is a cheap one 😂

7/16/19, 16:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: to focus more on yourself, have more time for yourself?
7/16/19, 16:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: or did I remember it wrong?
7/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: Yep
7/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: That’s it
7/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: But this morning between the friends and the pole dance class
7/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: I don’t know
7/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: Yesterday and today i’m feeling that i’m not spending the time as i want
7/16/19, 16:41 - Sara: Also my self esteem is not the best today haha
7/16/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did something happen?
7/16/19, 16:43 - Sara: Pole dance class
7/16/19, 16:43 - Sara: Today my motivation decreased a lot

7/16/19, 16:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't have time to talk now, right?
7/16/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't be too harsh on yourself
7/16/19, 16:45 - Sara: I have to finish the suitcase
7/16/19, 16:45 - Sara: I’m okay, don’t worry :)
7/16/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's something completely new and you are still barely starting

7/16/19, 16:45 - Sara: That’s the worst xD
7/16/19, 16:46 - Sara: When the teacher is in front observing me i do them
7/16/19, 16:46 - Sara: I feel the pressure
7/16/19, 16:46 - Sara: But not alone
7/16/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: quite often the mental barrier is much harder to overcome than physical
7/16/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing to be ashamed of
7/16/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: from what you sent me so far I think you're doing quite well
7/16/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: although, admittedly I am no expert on pole dance 😁

7/16/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's true
7/16/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end, probably just being honest is the best solution

7/16/19, 18:32 - Sara: It is a nice gif
7/16/19, 18:36 - Sara: Kamil, do you think i talk about myself a lot?
7/16/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's balanced, we talk about you, we talk about me, seems fine
7/16/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: you have a lot on your mind lately so naturally we talk about that a bit more
7/16/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's not really a problem that we do
7/16/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it's helpful, then it's actually great
7/16/19, 18:39 - Sara: Really?
7/16/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
7/16/19, 18:40 - Sara: Idk
7/16/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I want to hear how are you doing so at least from my point of view it's good
7/16/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, I think talking about ourselves to other people is quite helpful
7/16/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: helps understand and solve whatever issues we might have
7/16/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe not a golden solution, but definitely useful
7/16/19, 18:42 - Sara: I understand
7/16/19, 18:42 - Sara: But i told you i was bad and you ignored it
7/16/19, 18:42 - Sara: Maybe i should learn to deal it alone 😂
7/16/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked why and wanted to hear more
7/16/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought that maybe we could have a phone call or something
7/16/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least for me it's a bit better for that purpose
7/16/19, 18:43 - Sara: Yep

7/16/19, 18:44 - Sara: Thanks
7/16/19, 18:45 - Sara: But at the same time i think
7/16/19, 18:45 - Sara: If i hate myself, don’t find motivation in anything and i feel alone, what other can do? 😂
7/16/19, 18:46 - Sara: I rely on people a lot when it should not be like that
7/16/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: asking for help is nothing bad
7/16/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that whenever you need me, I'm here

7/17/19, 12:48 - Sara: In a bed

7/17/19, 22:12 - Sara: Haven’t you?
7/17/19, 22:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: That is exactly something I don't want to imagine 😂
7/17/19, 22:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: nope
7/17/19, 22:14 - Sara: Idk in my case
7/17/19, 22:14 - Sara: Well, my sister 😂
7/17/19, 22:14 - Sara: Probably her seeing me than the opposite
7/17/19, 22:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: so, are you watching the documentary?
7/17/19, 22:16 - Sara: Please xd
7/17/19, 22:16 - Sara: We have just arrived
7/17/19, 22:16 - Sara: Probably now
7/17/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, you started answering so I thought that you're already back
7/17/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: it was a bit suprising
7/17/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: such a fast girl
7/17/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: spanish question: what is the difference between enviar and mandar?
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: Hahha
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: The super is less than 5 minutes far
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: Hard question
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: I would say they are synonyms
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: But maybe with certain nouns sounds better one or another
7/17/19, 22:20 - Sara: But yeah, synonyms
7/17/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw you will watch the documentary on the internet, right?
7/17/19, 22:21 - Sara: Yep
7/17/19, 22:21 - Sara: Why?
7/17/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it crossed my mind that in that case we could watch it together
7/17/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: that website I mentioned yesterday, rabbit
7/17/19, 22:22 - Sara: I’ll watch it with my sis
7/17/19, 22:22 - Sara: It’s her idea
7/17/19, 22:22 - Sara: 😂
7/17/19, 22:22 - Sara: But i can ask
7/17/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know but it's just screen sharing
7/17/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: just a thought
7/17/19, 22:23 - Sara: Up to you
7/17/19, 22:23 - Sara: You tell me if you feel like
7/17/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I don't really have anything else to do
7/17/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: which is why I bother you all the time 😂
7/17/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: soooorry
7/17/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤗
7/17/19, 22:26 - Sara: You don’t

7/17/19, 22:35 - Sara: I’m trying but it does not work
7/17/19, 22:35 - Sara: Anyway, i would like to have this time with my sister
7/17/19, 22:35 - Sara: I’ll have time for you later, i promise
7/17/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, sure
7/17/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: it was only a suggestion, don't worry

7/17/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it is kind of funny
7/17/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: southern girl

7/18/19, 00:01 - Sara: These days you have been focusing on these
7/18/19, 00:01 - Sara: Like being more in touch, doing activities together
7/18/19, 00:01 - Sara: And it is when i’m busy
7/18/19, 00:02 - Sara: So i don’t want to let you down
7/18/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, it wasn't the best moment to do that
7/18/19, 00:02 - Sara: Why you say that?
7/18/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: just treat it as plans for the near future
7/18/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: you are busy and I'm coming up with all this stuff and making you feel like you let me down
7/18/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't
7/18/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand it and it's really not a problem
7/18/19, 00:03 - Sara: Sure?
7/18/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
7/18/19, 00:03 - Sara: Is it everything okay?
7/18/19, 00:04 - Sara: How are you dealing this?
7/18/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, not bad, I guess
7/18/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: trying to occupy myself somehow
7/18/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: on friday the festival begins so I hope to have something to do
7/18/19, 00:05 - Sara: Fair enough
7/18/19, 00:05 - Sara: I hope you have fun
7/18/19, 00:05 - Sara: I’ll miss ghent and you guys a lot
7/18/19, 00:06 - Sara: I hope you talk to me because you want to
7/18/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that just trying to find things to do
7/18/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: like learning, reading etc.
7/18/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: as an alternative to talking to you when you are not available
7/18/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really enjoy talking with you, never doubt that
7/18/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😘
7/18/19, 00:08 - Sara: Btw, i’m free now
7/18/19, 00:08 - Sara: Do you want to talk?
7/18/19, 00:08 - Sara: I’m afraid of someone having depencency, tbh
7/18/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: you just said that you need to wake up soon, no?
7/18/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, it's fine
7/18/19, 00:09 - Sara: Well, yes
7/18/19, 00:09 - Sara: I can be until 1
7/18/19, 00:09 - Sara: I prefer texting but you want to do video
7/18/19, 00:09 - Sara: I don’t want you to think i’m not involved
7/18/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: texting is also ok, I like video because I can see you
7/18/19, 00:10 - Sara: Sure?
7/18/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that it is a busy time for you
7/18/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry 🤗
7/18/19, 00:10 - Sara: You decide
7/18/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: texting is perfectly fine
7/18/19, 00:11 - Sara: Okay
7/18/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: you mentioned something in the instagram chat
7/18/19, 00:11 - Sara: Sorry, amor
7/18/19, 00:11 - Sara: Yep
7/18/19, 00:11 - Sara: Wait a sec
7/18/19, 00:11 - Sara: I’ll put the laptop in my bag
7/18/19, 00:13 - Sara: It was about the text right?
7/18/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, you said that you read something
7/18/19, 00:13 - Sara: Oh, in the text itself
7/18/19, 00:13 - Sara: Idk, i have always give everything to the rest
7/18/19, 00:14 - Sara: And there is a moment my battery is quite low
7/18/19, 00:14 - Sara: In a way i’m not taking care of me
7/18/19, 00:14 - Sara: And yep, in the text there were sentences about that which i have never thought but it is true
7/18/19, 00:15 - Sara: I’m afraid with our relationship, like you ask me to be always there
7/18/19, 00:15 - Sara: When i cannot sometimes
7/18/19, 00:15 - Sara: I forget about myself in general and i try to be the best to people not to forget me 😂
7/18/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, I didn't know that you felt that way
7/18/19, 00:16 - Sara: It is okay, don’t apologize
7/18/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that you are busy and of course you won't always have time for me
7/18/19, 00:16 - Sara: If it is like this, we will try to find a balance
7/18/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: after all, even in a relationship we should still be ourselves
7/18/19, 00:17 - Sara: Yes, of course
7/18/19, 00:17 - Sara: I told you that with Guada my relation was kind of dependence
7/18/19, 00:17 - Sara: Sometimes servitude
7/18/19, 00:17 - Sara: And, of course, i don’t that again
7/18/19, 00:17 - Sara: Neither this
7/18/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I definitely agree
7/18/19, 00:18 - Sara: I’m taking easy the relationship
7/18/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: sometimes I just ask if you have time, but don't feel that you need to find it for me
7/18/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: take it easy
7/18/19, 00:18 - Sara: Sure?
7/18/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course
7/18/19, 00:18 - Sara: I don’t want you to feel set apart
7/18/19, 00:18 - Sara: 😢
7/18/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: we've talked about this before I think, sometimes couples just spend all the time with each other and kind of lose themselves in a relationship
7/18/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really want this to happen
7/18/19, 00:19 - Sara: Me neither
7/18/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course I want to spend time with you
7/18/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: but there has to be balance
7/18/19, 00:20 - Sara: Of course
7/18/19, 00:20 - Sara: But i’m still feeling the pressure
7/18/19, 00:20 - Sara: Of being there always
7/18/19, 00:21 - Sara: Idk, you said about the series, the tests and everything
7/18/19, 00:21 - Sara: And i thought you wanted to do them now
7/18/19, 00:21 - Sara: Or in this period
7/18/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, no I meant in general, going forward
7/18/19, 00:21 - Sara: And i got overwhelmed
7/18/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: just something that I would like to do from time to time
7/18/19, 00:21 - Sara: And i would like to
7/18/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: you know, kind of like if I was there with you
7/18/19, 00:22 - Sara: ♥
7/18/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry if it felt like too much at hte same time, it wasn;t my intention
7/18/19, 00:23 - Sara: I know
7/18/19, 00:23 - Sara: Don’t worry
7/18/19, 00:23 - Sara: It is something new, i guess
7/18/19, 00:23 - Sara: It’s also about expectations
7/18/19, 00:23 - Sara: I want to fulfill them
7/18/19, 00:24 - Sara: I’m afraid if i let you down
7/18/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't
7/18/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is still a transition period and we are trying to figure out everything
7/18/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, for me it will be more next month, but something like that
7/18/19, 00:25 - Sara: For leaving Ghent, you mean?
7/18/19, 00:25 - Sara: And i’ll be there for you ♥
7/18/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: leaving Ghent, going back, figuring out my life again
7/18/19, 00:26 - Sara: Yes, i understand
7/18/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I think it will make more sense to talk about what we would like to do together and when once everything settles a bit
7/18/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: now I was just coming up with ideas to use in the future
7/18/19, 00:27 - Sara: Tell me :)
7/18/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, what we talked about yesterday
7/18/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: these sort of virtual dates
7/18/19, 00:28 - Sara: I don’t want you to feel sad and/or angry if i’m disappearing constantly or if we do’t talk that much
7/18/19, 00:28 - Sara: I was thinking about setting a day for us
7/18/19, 00:28 - Sara: Maybe with a kind of schedule
7/18/19, 00:29 - Sara: Of course we can modify it depending on the circumstances
7/18/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know yet how we can organise this, but yeah seems like a reasonable idea ☺
7/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: but here we are talking about these kind of longer activities, right?
7/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: because before we also talked about just texting
7/18/19, 00:30 - Sara: Yep
7/18/19, 00:30 - Sara: Video
7/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you mentioned that you like to just tell me about all the small things that happen
7/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: like : ohhhhh a spider
7/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤗
7/18/19, 00:31 - Sara: Yes hahaha
7/18/19, 00:31 - Sara: Why you mention this now? :3
7/18/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it is a different kind of interaction and I really like it
7/18/19, 00:32 - Sara: I mean, being able to call/text/ video call whatever we wanf but “meet” once a week
7/18/19, 00:32 - Sara: Me too
7/18/19, 00:32 - Sara: Like thoughts, info, facts
7/18/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, sounds good
7/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: Yes :)
7/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: Maybe at night we are more available
7/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: Well, we will see hah
7/18/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably, I was rather thinking about the evenings or nights
7/18/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: now I'm available most of the time but later it will probably change
7/18/19, 00:34 - Sara: The same
7/18/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: so yeah, something like that
7/18/19, 00:34 - Sara: Nice ☺♥
7/18/19, 00:34 - Sara: Mmmm i’ll try to find something
7/18/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: now, that I think about it, I guess also if you just happen to have nothing to do sometimes we can probably also try to organise something
7/18/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: just asking, but without any pressure
7/18/19, 00:37 - Sara: Organise trips?
7/18/19, 00:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/18/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: also but I meant these sort of meetings like the ones we will try to schedule
7/18/19, 00:37 - Sara: https://www.weshouldtryit.com/questions/
7/18/19, 00:38 - Sara: Yep, of course
7/18/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: but only if we really don't have other plans
7/18/19, 00:38 - Sara: Maybe after me coming back
7/18/19, 00:38 - Sara: Okay
7/18/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure, that's what I meant
7/18/19, 00:38 - Sara: 👌🏻 great
7/18/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm trying to think of it like regular dating
7/18/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: so something like this: you don't have any plans, you call me if I want to meet
7/18/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: or vice versa
7/18/19, 00:39 - Sara: As well
7/18/19, 00:39 - Sara: I like that
7/18/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: wait, this is not for lond distance, right?
7/18/19, 00:40 - Sara: Questions about sex
7/18/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: it seems more like a list of thing to try
7/18/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I like it 💋
7/18/19, 00:41 - Sara: Hahhaha nah, it is about if the other one likes it

7/18/19, 00:50 - Sara: It’s a beautiful connection
7/18/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/18/19, 00:52 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/18/19, 00:52 - Sara: So yep, anything else to say? :)

7/18/19, 00:59 - Sara: Specially after erasmus
7/18/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: although I would prefer to extend at least to the solar system
7/18/19, 00:59 - Sara: With the moon in between 🌝
7/18/19, 00:59 - Sara: But yep
7/18/19, 01:00 - Sara: You should not be ashamed of your roots
7/18/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not

7/18/19, 01:05 - Sara: If you need something, just let me know :)
7/18/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw, why a violet heart? Is there any reason?
7/18/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that different colors have different meanings but in this case?
7/18/19, 01:05 - Sara: I like hearts
7/18/19, 01:05 - Sara: I like colours
7/18/19, 01:05 - Sara: Maybe? Mmmmm
7/18/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was curious specifically about the color choice
7/18/19, 01:06 - Sara: https://www.karenlotter.com/2018/03/what-do-different-colored-emoji-hearts-mean/
7/18/19, 01:06 - Sara: A purple (violet) heart can symbolize a sensitive, understanding and compassionate love.  This heart emoji is regularly used to portray glamour or wealth.   WhatsApp: The violet heart emoji stands for sexuality. Could mean that the chat partner is keen on you or wants to talk about an amorous adventure.
7/18/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already checked it when you sent me a violet one before
7/18/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤗
7/18/19, 01:06 - Sara: Ohhhh
7/18/19, 01:07 - Sara: That’s a trap
7/18/19, 01:07 - Sara: I do it randomly
7/18/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's what I wanted to know
7/18/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it was random or not
7/18/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: ☺
7/18/19, 01:07 - Sara: I’ll try to do it knowing the meaning hahaha
7/18/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: "The violet heart emoji stands for sexuality. Could mean that the chat partner is keen on you or wants to talk about an amorous adventure."
7/18/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like the violet one
7/18/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: definitely keep using it
7/18/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💜

7/18/19, 01:55 - Sara: And I started to cry
7/18/19, 01:55 - Sara: I have never has this feeling
7/18/19, 01:56 - Sara: Probably of letting things go

7/18/19, 01:56 - Sara: What is this?

7/18/19, 01:57 - Sara: He also started telling me that i’m a great support to him with his problems
7/18/19, 01:57 - Sara: And idk how i am suffering for it
7/18/19, 01:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree with that
7/18/19, 01:58 - Sara: So idk what to do
7/18/19, 01:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: agree with that you are a great support, for me too

7/18/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: ups, sorry, wrote it to fast
7/18/19, 01:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: but why do you compare yourself?
7/18/19, 01:59 - Sara: “I like her a lot and i don’t want to lose her” probably he never said that about me
7/18/19, 02:00 - Sara: Probably because of me everything could have been better
7/18/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't feel bad about his mistakes
7/18/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: if he didn't appreciate you, that's his fault
7/18/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: you didn't deserve it
7/18/19, 02:00 - Sara: They are mine i suppose
7/18/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/18/19, 02:01 - Sara: I don’t know now 🙁
7/18/19, 02:01 - Sara: I’m still feeling the break up was my fault
7/18/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: but now you also feel like he never actually appreciated you
7/18/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: so how is that your fault?
7/18/19, 02:02 - Sara: Not being enough
7/18/19, 02:02 - Sara: Not enough to deal with the problema
7/18/19, 02:02 - Sara: Problems
7/18/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: in a realtionship you have to deal with problems together
7/18/19, 02:04 - Sara: Yes, i suppose
7/18/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I unfortunately don't know your history together very well
7/18/19, 02:04 - Sara: It is okay :)
7/18/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you've talked about it with Christian also
7/18/19, 02:05 - Sara: Yep
7/18/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really believe that is wasn't your fault
7/18/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: from what I know now you weren't treated fairly
7/18/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: you mentioned something like servitude even
7/18/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's not how it should work
7/18/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least that's what I believe

7/18/19, 02:17 - Sara: Now you are on holidaaays :3
7/18/19, 02:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: happens to me sometimes when I don't have to go to uni or something like that
7/18/19, 02:18 - Sara: Oh
7/18/19, 02:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, so it's not so bad 😋
7/18/19, 02:18 - Sara: I dont want to fuck it up but i would like to go to sleep
7/18/19, 02:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wholehearteadly support that idea
7/18/19, 02:19 - Sara: 😂
7/18/19, 02:19 - Sara: I’ll try xd
7/18/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dobranoc, kotku 💋
7/18/19, 02:20 - Sara: You also
7/18/19, 02:20 - Sara: Cat?
7/18/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup
7/18/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: you've seen it already, no?
7/18/19, 02:21 - Sara: I remembered for another time
7/18/19, 02:21 - Sara: Between you and Guada i cannot xd
7/18/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: whatever you prefer, if you need it we can keep talking
7/18/19, 02:22 - Sara: Okay
7/18/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm here for you
7/18/19, 02:22 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/18/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw I think it really shows what a great, loving a caring person you are that you want to help him be fine with his girlfriend even though it hurts you
7/18/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: no words to describe ❤
7/18/19, 02:24 - Sara: Well
7/18/19, 02:24 - Sara: It is a pure shit
7/18/19, 02:24 - Sara: But thanks haha
7/18/19, 02:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/18/19, 02:24 - Sara: Because it hurts
7/18/19, 02:25 - Sara: And feeling like that is not good
7/18/19, 02:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, and you do it anyway
7/18/19, 02:25 - Sara: Idk if run away
7/18/19, 02:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still in awe how much you care about people around you
7/18/19, 02:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: even if it's not easy
7/18/19, 02:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: sometimes you said that you feel weak
7/18/19, 02:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that shows me that it's completely not true
7/18/19, 02:27 - Sara: Why not weak?
7/18/19, 02:27 - Sara: I’m crying all the time 😂
7/18/19, 02:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: because it's not easy
7/18/19, 02:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you are their for your friends anyway
7/18/19, 02:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: there*
7/18/19, 02:27 - Sara: Idk if you have this idiom
7/18/19, 02:28 - Sara: A person is silly when they are too good people
7/18/19, 02:28 - Sara: I’m a fool
7/18/19, 02:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it depends to which people
7/18/19, 02:28 - Sara: Extremely fool
7/18/19, 02:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you are a great support but it's not reciprocated at all it's probably not the best idea
7/18/19, 02:29 - Sara: Yep
7/18/19, 02:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end it comes down again to you valuing yourself more
7/18/19, 02:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: and caring about yourself
7/18/19, 02:30 - Sara: Yes
7/18/19, 02:30 - Sara: Fair enough
7/18/19, 02:30 - Sara: But puf
7/18/19, 02:30 - Sara: I feel weak for this feeling i have for him of being there
7/18/19, 02:31 - Sara: He has just told me he feels relieved because he can count on me c:
7/18/19, 02:31 - Sara: If i get distance he’ll suffer
7/18/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: you thought it was the love of your life, of course you have those feelings
7/18/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: but having them doesn't make you weak
7/18/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: just human
7/18/19, 02:32 - Sara: Fuck feelings xd
7/18/19, 02:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe you need to have another honest conversation
7/18/19, 02:33 - Sara: Not now
7/18/19, 02:33 - Sara: Next week
7/18/19, 02:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: you try to support him, it has to be mutual
7/18/19, 02:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, of course
7/18/19, 02:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant in general
7/18/19, 02:33 - Sara: It is
7/18/19, 02:33 - Sara: Maybe distance will benefit him, also me
7/18/19, 02:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you truly want to let go than probably yes
7/18/19, 02:34 - Sara: Idk ugh
7/18/19, 02:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: we talked before that you need closure
7/18/19, 02:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you had it yet
7/18/19, 02:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you really want to move on
7/18/19, 02:35 - Sara: Closure?
7/18/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: like, that you know that that chapter of your life is over
7/18/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: that you turned the page
7/18/19, 02:35 - Sara: Ohh okay
7/18/19, 02:36 - Sara: Yep, i will have it
7/18/19, 02:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end you have to ask yourself what you truly want
7/18/19, 02:37 - Sara: Yes, i agree
7/18/19, 02:37 - Sara: **jumps from a 4th floor**
7/18/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it does solve some problems
7/18/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: but Kamil would be sad
7/18/19, 02:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/18/19, 02:38 - Sara: I don’t want that
7/18/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: great, so we know one thing that you don't want 🙂
7/18/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: now we just need to figure out the rest
7/18/19, 02:39 - Sara: 😂😂😂

7/18/19, 02:43 - Sara: Te quiero
7/18/19, 02:43 - Sara: I’ll go to sleep
7/18/19, 02:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: at this point you can probably just skip sleeping completely 😁
7/18/19, 02:44 - Sara: I prefer sleeping
7/18/19, 02:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tambien te quiero ❤

7/19/19, 21:44 - Sara: Thanks ♥ but too physical approach
7/19/19, 21:45 - Sara: It was funny until he started to ask me for a kiss, smell my hair and touched almost my boobs
7/19/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's pretty fast
7/19/19, 21:46 - Sara: That’s disgusting

7/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: But idk, we were having fun dancing
7/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: He didn’t ask me if i had a couple
7/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: He didn’t realize my constant rejections
7/19/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: sadly girls alone in the crowd will always be targets for people like that
7/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: Yes
7/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: Also know
7/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: We wanted to go by foot to the flap

7/19/19, 21:50 - Sara: Tram
7/19/19, 21:50 - Sara: My sister has just said there was a weird guy looking at us

7/19/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me when you arrive in the flat
7/19/19, 21:53 - Sara: Okay :)

7/19/19, 21:56 - Sara: Worried*
7/19/19, 21:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because of what you just told me of course
7/19/19, 21:57 - Sara: It is okay
7/19/19, 21:58 - Sara: I mean
7/19/19, 21:58 - Sara: It wasn’t that bad
7/19/19, 21:58 - Sara: I can defend myself
7/19/19, 21:58 - Sara: But in this case i could not do anything idk
7/19/19, 21:59 - Sara: But again, we are okay
7/19/19, 22:00 - Sara: Thanks for caring, but it finished
7/19/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's good
7/19/19, 22:01 - Sara: If we find them again i will tell him the truth
7/19/19, 22:01 - Sara: And if he calles me, i won’t pick it up 😂
7/19/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you mean the truth?
7/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: But yeah, the amusing park was amazing
7/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: (Btw, 13% battery)
7/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: I don’t want anything
7/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: Maybe just by saying it, guys will understand it
7/19/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: why didn't you tell him that before?
7/19/19, 22:03 - Sara: This
7/19/19, 22:03 - Sara: Afraid
7/19/19, 22:03 - Sara: Guys use the strategy to separate the two friends
7/19/19, 22:03 - Sara: I wasn’t with my sis
7/19/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, good thinking on your side
7/19/19, 22:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: good that he let go after you gave him the number

7/19/19, 22:04 - Sara: But we want to rest
7/19/19, 22:04 - Sara: Sorry if this annoys you
7/19/19, 22:04 - Sara: Even if i was single, i didn’t intend anything
7/19/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry, I didn't imply anything like that
7/19/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: sorry if it sounded like that
7/19/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I trust you
7/19/19, 22:05 - Sara: Not at all, just in case
7/19/19, 22:05 - Sara: Thanks ♥
7/19/19, 22:06 - Sara: The same :)
7/19/19, 22:06 - Sara: Just knowing you as a couple 🤗
7/19/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: what annoys me is that girls cannot just travel alone without the danger of something like that
7/19/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: it sucks
7/19/19, 22:08 - Sara: But we are not alone 😂
7/19/19, 22:08 - Sara: One is with the other
7/19/19, 22:08 - Sara: We are alone if we don’t go with guys, according to society
7/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: It didn’t happen in Porto
7/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: We can, but with this
7/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: Yep, it was okay to deal until he said goodbye and touched this part of the chest before the boobs and moved

7/19/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's not Madrid but come on
7/19/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not that small
7/19/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ljubljana is smaller
7/19/19, 22:58 - Sara: Not about that
7/19/19, 22:58 - Sara: Have you checked?
7/19/19, 22:58 - Sara: I mean like stone-colored city
7/19/19, 22:58 - Sara: Simpler?
7/19/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok
7/19/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: That actually sounds cool
7/19/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bratislava has more or less 150 thousand people more
7/19/19, 23:00 - Sara: Yep!
7/19/19, 23:00 - Sara: Like more friendly, less touristic
7/19/19, 23:00 - Sara: Damn
7/19/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Area wise even Toledo is actually bigger than Ljubljana
7/19/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's one of the reasons why I like it
7/19/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: So small and cute 😊
7/19/19, 23:02 - Sara: Toledo or Ljubljana? Hehe
7/19/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ljubljana of course
7/19/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Toledo maybe as well, we'll see...
7/19/19, 23:03 - Sara: You’ll see :)
7/19/19, 23:04 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rude, such tease
7/19/19, 23:04 - Sara: I can tease more 🌝
7/19/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:05 - Sara: 🌚
7/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: I was dancing in the party
7/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: And i thought
7/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: Damn, i want to twerk Kamil so much
7/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: And dance with him so close
7/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: I think dancing creates links and produce great feelings
7/19/19, 23:07 - Sara: So yeah, you are warned :p
7/19/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have to teach me
7/19/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely agree
7/19/19, 23:07 - Sara: What exactly? ;)
7/19/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: How to dance so that I don't embarrass myself anymore 😋
7/19/19, 23:08 - Sara: Anymore? When? XD
7/19/19, 23:08 - Sara: You don’t embarrass
7/19/19, 23:08 - Sara: Again, that’s so sweet and attractive when you dance :3
7/19/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ya, ya for sure not
7/19/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember you laughing 🤣🤣🤣
7/19/19, 23:09 - Sara: Not laughing in a bad sense :,(
7/19/19, 23:09 - Sara: But like “gosh, i like him so bad”
7/19/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, some practice definitely would not hurt
7/19/19, 23:10 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:10 - Sara: Of course not ;)
7/19/19, 23:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will definitely remind you of that when we meet
7/19/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll go take a shower, I'll be back in 20 minutes
7/19/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: then we can talk or something if you feel like 🥰
7/19/19, 23:16 - Sara: Why? :o

7/19/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have one more, without the duck face 🌝
7/19/19, 23:37 - Sara: 🌚
7/19/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I'm a bit shy
7/19/19, 23:37 - Sara: Don’t worry
7/19/19, 23:37 - Sara: Just do what you want to do :)
7/19/19, 23:38 - Sara: ♥
7/19/19, 23:38 - Sara: I won’t force you
7/19/19, 23:38 - Sara: Don’t feel you are obligued
7/19/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: none of that
7/19/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if you will like it 🌝
7/19/19, 23:39 - Sara: Let me see and i’ll tell you 🌝
7/19/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

7/19/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/19/19, 23:40 - Sara: You ass has a quite nice shape, just saying 💚
7/19/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: green one is for jealousy xd 😂
7/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: Of ass

7/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: Obviously!
7/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: Someday my ass will be better than yours :p
7/19/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's already great 😍
7/19/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you know, we could compare if you had a photo...
7/19/19, 23:42 - Sara: Thanks!
7/19/19, 23:42 - Sara: My patch is horrible 😑
7/19/19, 23:44 - Sara: I’ll take all my photos when i have the period or in winter, that i can change its place haha
7/19/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: however you like, but I don't really mind it at all
7/19/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: quite the contrary
7/19/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: patch = no polish babies
7/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: Really? Not at all?
7/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: True 😂
7/19/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course not
7/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: But its glue moves and it’s black ugh
7/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: 🤗
7/19/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, you can take a picture now, and some more later 🌝
7/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: Btw, i was trying to find a question, i was kind of curious
7/19/19, 23:46 - Sara: Again, the patch this week looks horrible ☹
7/19/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, your choice
7/19/19, 23:46 - Sara: Not angry?
7/19/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: why? of course not
7/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Sounds like that
7/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Maybe because is written
7/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Haha
7/19/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's why I prefer to talk 💋
7/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Yes 😚
7/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Even without condom ans having prevention, is it wrong to have sex with a close partner?
7/19/19, 23:48 - Sara: I mean, if you know the other person does not have ets’s...
7/19/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it is wrong
7/19/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I'm just a bit paranoid, that's all
7/19/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: also you know that I have some issues with where am I supposed to finish 🤣
7/19/19, 23:50 - Sara: Not because of you (although it is somethinf i have in mind, and of course i won’t try to change it)
7/19/19, 23:50 - Sara: But sexually talking, is it prudent?
7/19/19, 23:50 - Sara: Why issues?
7/19/19, 23:51 - Sara: I mean
7/19/19, 23:51 - Sara: You don’t like it, that’s not an issue
7/19/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, you remember that when you were doing oral for example I was a bit afraid of having an orgasm because I didn't want to make a mess
7/19/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not that I don't like it, I think it can be great
7/19/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: you mean doing it without a condom? or with?
7/19/19, 23:53 - Sara: Without
7/19/19, 23:53 - Sara: Dangerous?
7/19/19, 23:53 - Sara: So?
7/19/19, 23:53 - Sara: Mess that you can clean 😂
7/19/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: and potential babies 🤣
7/19/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that you use patches
7/19/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: but still I'm a bit blocked
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: Well, but there is still a possibility
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: Understandable
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: Man, it was not about convincing you
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: It is okay :)
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: If we try or we don’t, i’ll love you and i’ll like it anyway :)
7/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: But about having a safe sex life
7/19/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: we'll see, I am kind of curious about it
7/19/19, 23:55 - Sara: About what exactly? Two topics at the same time
7/19/19, 23:55 - Sara: Hahha
7/19/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: no condom
7/19/19, 23:56 - Sara: Yep, me too
7/19/19, 23:56 - Sara: I didn’t have any baby yet so it works haha
7/19/19, 23:56 - Sara: But yes, i have to ensure that i do everything correct 😂
7/19/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess we don't have to go all the way
7/19/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, we can try something
7/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: It is okay
7/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: We will se
7/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: See*
7/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: But not... unmm i don’t remember the name in english
7/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: Wait
7/19/19, 23:58 - Sara: Withdrawal
7/19/19, 23:58 - Sara: Or coitus interruptus #latinlover
7/19/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: pulling out? 🤣
7/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: Yep
7/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: Basically
7/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: But again
7/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: No pressure at all
7/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: Neither for me about sperm in any part of my body 😂
7/19/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know but I am curious so no problem
7/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: It is about the moment
7/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: Me too :p
7/20/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: or maybe you just really want that polish-spanish hybrid?
7/20/19, 00:01 - Sara: Of course
7/20/19, 00:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/20/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: tortured by it's duality it's existence would be pain
7/20/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤣
7/20/19, 00:02 - Sara: Why duality?
7/20/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😨
7/20/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: polish cold, spanish heat
7/20/19, 00:03 - Sara: 💥
7/20/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: he or she wouldn't handle the cold weather, wouldn't handle the hot weather
7/20/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: basically nowhere to live
7/20/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😝
7/20/19, 00:03 - Sara: *they :p
7/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: Like us :)
7/20/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: you want more than one?!?!?
7/20/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤣🤣🤣
7/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: Hahahahha naah
7/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: They is the neutral pronoun
7/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: Instead of saying “she and he”
7/20/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but I had to make a joke
7/20/19, 00:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/20/19, 00:05 - Sara: As you say
7/20/19, 00:05 - Sara: THAT’S NOT A JOKE WHY DO YOU SAY IT IS A JOKE
7/20/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm laughing now and then: honey, you're gonna be a father 😅
7/20/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should probably do some research on starting a new life in mexico
7/20/19, 00:06 - Sara: Maybe i’m pregnant
7/20/19, 00:06 - Sara: You don’t know
7/20/19, 00:06 - Sara: Find the cheapest 😂
7/20/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: so tomorrow you go to Bratislava?
7/20/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: whole day?
7/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: Yep
7/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: Coming at night
7/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: But we want to save the day there :B
7/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: You brussels?
7/20/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: what else do you want to visit?
7/20/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: most likely
7/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: There or on general?
7/20/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: both
7/20/19, 00:09 - Sara: The same as the day you went with us? 🌝
7/20/19, 00:09 - Sara: There... About discovering there, i have some ideas but i don’t remember what exactly
7/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: Also, there are some cute villages near the Danub in a part of austria. We want to see them by boat
7/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: And also, enjoy more Vienna 🤗
7/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: Danube xD
7/20/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: That sounds awesome
7/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: Yes 💜
7/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: Btw, have you seen my insta poll?
7/20/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: sexual intentions with cute villages? muy mal xd
7/20/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I did not, I'll check
7/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: Hahhaa shit
7/20/19, 00:14 - Sara: Would like your opinion :p
7/20/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: did you get the idea for the condom questions because of the song? 😆
7/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Probably 😂
7/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: But it was in my mind for a time
7/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Just remembered it
7/20/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would say it's pretty important
7/20/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: not the most important
7/20/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: but definitely matters
7/20/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's actually scientifically proven that couples with good sex life are significantly happier
7/20/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: not really suprising
7/20/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: there are far more important things
7/20/19, 00:18 - Sara: Leaving out research
7/20/19, 00:18 - Sara: What about yoy
7/20/19, 00:18 - Sara: You*
7/20/19, 00:19 - Sara: Agreee
7/20/19, 00:19 - Sara: But disagree 😂
7/20/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, I think it definitely has some importance
7/20/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: brings us a bit closer
7/20/19, 00:20 - Sara: Yes, of course
7/20/19, 00:20 - Sara: In trust, right?
7/20/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: talking and learning more about each other is far more important
7/20/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, without trust it's not really a relationship
7/20/19, 00:21 - Sara: I mean
7/20/19, 00:21 - Sara: Sex is not only sex in itself
7/20/19, 00:21 - Sara: But for me that I can be naked in front of another person is a big step
7/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: Also the jokes in between, talking about that
7/20/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Absolutely agreed
7/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: It is really beautiful
7/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: And i love that
7/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: It is a way i can know someone and most of the people don’t
7/20/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: for the relation between two people what happens before and after sex is the best part
7/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: It is not a limitation or something selfish, but a privilege
7/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: I feel lucky for having sex with you
7/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: It is great, but not the best
7/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: Wait, what do you mean?
7/20/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I mean best from the whole sexual act
7/20/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: not in general
7/20/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: just cuddling after is so great
7/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: But what about us, that we cannot have sex that easy? What about people who has not sexual attraction? They are not a real xouple?
7/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: ♥😭🤗
7/20/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's not what I meant
7/20/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's just that it in itself is great, but not completely necessary
7/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: Rt and fav
7/20/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: feeling that someone cares about you and having trust in each other is what's important
7/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: But you can get that without sec
7/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: Sex
7/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: Well
7/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: One of my uni bestfriends
7/20/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, that's what I meant with this
7/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: She is dating with her actual boyfriend since 2012
7/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: And they didn’t have sex
7/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: Idk if masturbation but yep, let’s say they don’t
7/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: Idk what to think about that
7/20/19, 00:27 - Sara: A couple can be a couple if they don’t have sexual attraction? If we are talking about people who feel attraction
7/20/19, 00:27 - Sara: (As far as i know)
7/20/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: difficult question
7/20/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: honestly, no idea
7/20/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: but if they are happy, it's all that matters
7/20/19, 00:28 - Sara: True :)
7/20/19, 00:28 - Sara: They are fucking cute, i love them a lot ♥
7/20/19, 00:28 - Sara: So yep
7/20/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: *not fucking
7/20/19, 00:29 - Sara: Would you love me if i want not to have sex w/you? Or if it in another far dimension i want to be virgin until marriage
7/20/19, 00:29 - Sara: 😂
7/20/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so, but it is a difficult question
7/20/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: also, would we actually end up together then?
7/20/19, 00:30 - Sara: Like overthinking, in a good sense in this case
7/20/19, 00:30 - Sara: Bcause ideology?
7/20/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: after all it's what got us together in the first place
7/20/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, I mean if we would even meet
7/20/19, 00:30 - Sara: True 😂
7/20/19, 00:31 - Sara: Yep, but if you had known me in another circumstance
7/20/19, 00:31 - Sara: Or if you meet a new girl in a normal circumstance 😂
7/20/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so
7/20/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: before meeting you I guess I would be sceptical

7/21/19, 23:35 - Sara: History?
7/21/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, but it's not written like a textbook
7/21/19, 23:36 - Sara: How then?
7/21/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: author gives facts but also his opinions, also elaborates on the events that happened and gives different perspectives
7/21/19, 23:37 - Sara: That is cool 😁
7/21/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's not just a list of stuff that happened
7/21/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a version in polish but the original is actually in english
7/21/19, 23:38 - Sara: Oh what is the title?
7/21/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: god's playground
7/21/19, 23:38 - Sara: Nice, gracias 🤩
7/21/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: interestingly, the very first written mention of what later became Poland was written by a guy who came from Spain
7/21/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: specifically from Tortosa in Catalonia
7/21/19, 23:39 - Sara: Damn really? Why?
7/21/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: it was in 965, he was sent by some arab ruler to get in touch with the Holy Roman empire
7/21/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: and he also visited Czechs
7/21/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: if he could make that trip, you can too
7/21/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
7/21/19, 23:42 - Sara: From Cataluña to Czech Republic?
7/21/19, 23:43 - Sara: I have to really love someone to do that 🤔
7/21/19, 23:43 - Sara: To return my alien
7/21/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe Jason Momoa will be visiting Poland or Czech Republic
7/21/19, 23:45 - Sara: 🥰❤💋
7/21/19, 23:45 - Sara: Going there soon then :p
7/21/19, 23:45 - Sara: You say yellow is a horrible color

7/21/19, 23:47 - Sara: It started to rain a lot but we entered in the yellow abbey and had lunch inside so we avoided it
7/21/19, 23:48 - Sara: We have just met a Romanian waited who lived in Alicante
7/21/19, 23:48 - Sara: Damn his spanish, always with swear words
7/21/19, 23:48 - Sara: My sis and i think that Spanish people are regarded as that violent 😂
7/21/19, 23:49 - Sara: And the food there was excellent, fair enough
7/21/19, 23:49 - Sara: Then the two hours boat trip 🤩
7/21/19, 23:49 - Sara: So relaxing in the top of the boat, seeing little villages
7/21/19, 23:50 - Sara: And then in Krems we could see nice monuments, but less than in Melk
7/21/19, 23:50 - Sara: There was a problem in the train Melk-Vienna
7/21/19, 23:50 - Sara: So we had to take a bus and then another train
7/21/19, 23:50 - Sara: Extra 1h and a half

7/22/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: but if you feel like just talking about it now, sure why not
7/22/19, 00:16 - Sara: What you meant here?

7/22/19, 22:50 - Sara: They were about 30 when this happened
7/22/19, 22:51 - Sara: Also the tradition of doing 👍 to catch a car stopped because of this
7/22/19, 22:51 - Sara: Or at least it is quite rejected
7/22/19, 22:51 - Sara: Hitchhicking?

7/23/19, 10:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: this will require more testing
7/23/19, 10:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌚
7/23/19, 10:16 - Sara: Sex marathon, sex marathon
7/23/19, 10:16 - Sara: I’m really serious
7/23/19, 10:16 - Sara: I really desire to try it haha
7/23/19, 10:17 - Sara: Like literally spending one day in bed
7/23/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: well of course
7/23/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't forget your satisfyer though 💋
7/23/19, 10:17 - Sara: Of course 👌🏻
7/23/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure at some point it will be useful
7/23/19, 10:17 - Sara: But uf, so embarassing 😂
7/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: Why useful? ;)
7/23/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I can rest my tongue 🌝
7/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: Ummm
7/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: One question
7/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: You don’t normally practice oral sex
7/23/19, 10:19 - Sara: Is it because you prefer other practices?
7/23/19, 10:19 - Sara: Btw, if you want to study tell me
7/23/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like it and I want to get better at it
7/23/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes I'm not in the mood to do it, yes
7/23/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's nothing too unusual, I think
7/23/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: if I learn more, I will do it more often 😘💜
7/23/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: so, you know, it's in your best interest to educate me
7/23/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
7/23/19, 10:21 - Sara: Educate you?
7/23/19, 10:21 - Sara: Uh babe, i didn’t now i was your teacher
7/23/19, 10:21 - Sara: Excellent
7/23/19, 10:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/23/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, give me tips or just allow me to practice 🥰
7/23/19, 10:21 - Sara: I’ll :p
7/23/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: nobody knows what you like better than you
7/23/19, 10:22 - Sara: That is true
7/23/19, 10:22 - Sara: But there is very good tips online
7/23/19, 10:22 - Sara: But of course trying i can tell you
7/23/19, 10:22 - Sara: The same as you can tell ms
7/23/19, 10:22 - Sara: Me*
7/23/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I've already watched some before and I will watch moe
7/23/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: but they are more general
7/23/19, 10:23 - Sara: Of course
7/23/19, 10:23 - Sara: Sara is an endangered species
7/23/19, 10:23 - Sara: Fortunatelly haha
7/23/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: you can tell me something specific for you
7/23/19, 10:23 - Sara: Of course
7/23/19, 10:23 - Sara: But at the moment i don’t know
7/23/19, 10:24 - Sara: Just come :,)
7/23/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, sure, I meant later when we actually meet
7/23/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
7/23/19, 10:24 - Sara: 😚
7/23/19, 10:24 - Sara: Why am i always talking about sex? I feel bad 😂
7/23/19, 10:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't mind ❤
7/23/19, 10:26 - Sara: But i don’t want to focus our relationship on that
7/23/19, 10:26 - Sara: I don’t want you to think that
7/23/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: come on, we talk about other things all the time
7/23/19, 10:26 - Sara: Really? :)
7/23/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think we have a problem here
7/23/19, 10:26 - Sara: Okay
7/23/19, 10:27 - Sara: If i’m monothematic tell me
7/23/19, 10:27 - Sara: ;)
7/23/19, 10:27 - Sara: I’m watching a video about lubricants
7/23/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: most of the time for you it's a rain forest down there rather than Sahara
7/23/19, 10:28 - Sara: And damn, i need one for my satysfier
7/23/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: but they can be useful
7/23/19, 10:28 - Sara: And i also hate the durex one haha
7/23/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤
7/23/19, 10:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: The one I bought in Ghent?
7/23/19, 10:29 - Sara: 😂
7/23/19, 10:29 - Sara: Accurate
7/23/19, 10:29 - Sara: Yes
7/23/19, 10:29 - Sara: Silicone-based and commercial one
7/23/19, 10:29 - Sara: I need a water-based one
7/23/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/23/19, 10:30 - Sara: Why what exactly? :p
7/23/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: why water based?
7/23/19, 10:30 - Sara: Better for penetration (also valid for sex in water) and for sex toys
7/23/19, 10:31 - Sara: I’m doing a test about which one use and when
7/23/19, 10:31 - Sara: Maybe the one we have is for oral sex
7/23/19, 10:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: is it better?
7/23/19, 10:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think sillicone one lasts longer
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: No wait
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: Ay
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: Nop
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: Silicone is for underwater
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: Wait
7/23/19, 10:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/23/19, 10:33 - Sara: I’m reading this now
7/23/19, 10:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/23/19, 10:33 - Sara: But in general i prefer brands less comercialized and more focused on sex
7/23/19, 10:33 - Sara: Like buying something i know
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: Rather than going to the supermarket and take the first thing you see haha
7/23/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, in that case I needed something quick, soooorry
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: Yes yes
7/23/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end it wasn't that useful, but well
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: I don’t blame you
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: I blame durex for existing
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: Why?
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: It is and it was :)
7/23/19, 10:34 - Sara: And it will be ;)
7/23/19, 10:35 - Sara: True
7/23/19, 10:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: most of the time it wasn't neccessary, (ekhm, rain forest)
7/23/19, 10:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that's actually very good 💜
7/23/19, 10:35 - Sara: Ekhm?
7/23/19, 10:35 - Sara: But idk if it is always necessary
7/23/19, 10:35 - Sara: Or improve
7/23/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably not a bad idea to always use something
7/23/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: definitely won't make it worse
7/23/19, 10:36 - Sara: Not at all
7/23/19, 10:37 - Sara: Now i’m curious what you meant haha
7/23/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's like coughing to get someones attention
7/23/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think
7/23/19, 10:38 - Sara: Love your reference of rain forest of me being as wet as fuck
7/23/19, 10:38 - Sara: Ohh, okay okay i thought it was a noun and i was like ????
7/23/19, 10:38 - Sara: But yes
7/23/19, 10:38 - Sara: Sooorry

7/25/19, 10:21 - Sara: Pretty, slim, smart
7/25/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Caring, beautiful, intelligent, funny
7/25/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😍
7/25/19, 10:22 - Sara: Yep, that is what i want to be 😊
7/25/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said you would like to dress differently
7/25/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you have in mind?
7/25/19, 10:24 - Sara: Black makes me feel good
7/25/19, 10:24 - Sara: But at the same time i want to run away from that
7/25/19, 10:24 - Sara: So idk
7/25/19, 10:24 - Sara: Just different, extravagant
7/25/19, 10:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/25/19, 10:25 - Sara: Not plain or like everybody else
7/25/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whatever makes you feel good ♥️
7/25/19, 10:26 - Sara: I have to find out what haha
7/25/19, 10:27 - Sara: The more i show the better 😂
7/25/19, 10:27 - Sara: I’ll see
7/25/19, 10:27 - Sara: But i’m lost with everything
7/25/19, 10:27 - Sara: I’ll have a shower
7/25/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: But why, there has to be some reason that you feel like that suddenly?
7/25/19, 10:28 - Sara: It is not sudden
7/25/19, 10:28 - Sara: Since i arrived to Toledo after the festival i feel like that
7/25/19, 10:29 - Sara: Realising that my life depended on someone and now i have to built my life again
7/25/19, 10:29 - Sara: I’m like this for ages, buf i have my periods
7/25/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everyone feels lost sometimes, especially in the transition periods
7/25/19, 10:30 - Sara: Probably, yes
7/25/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You shouldn't feel bad about it in my opinion
7/25/19, 10:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Uncertainty makes us (or at least me) a bit uneasy
7/25/19, 10:31 - Sara: I don’t feel bad because of transitions
7/25/19, 10:31 - Sara: I feel bad because i’m horrible 😂
7/25/19, 10:32 - Sara: And idk, i feel alone
7/25/19, 10:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can I help with that somehow?
7/25/19, 10:32 - Sara: It is okay :)
7/25/19, 10:33 - Sara: Do not worry :)
7/25/19, 10:33 - Sara: I mean, we have to live our lives and support each other
7/25/19, 10:33 - Sara: You do it
7/25/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I do 😔
7/25/19, 10:40 - Sara: Why do you say that?
7/25/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: It seems like I cannot help with anything, I just talk and it's not very useful
7/25/19, 10:42 - Sara: Sometimes i feel like you ignore i’m bad, or just indifference
7/25/19, 10:42 - Sara: But reality it that i don’t let people know it
7/25/19, 10:43 - Sara: Because i do not want to disturb
7/25/19, 10:43 - Sara: I do not take my problems or feeings seriously
7/25/19, 10:43 - Sara: So people treat them like that
7/25/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok if sometimes you keep your problems to yourself but maybe discussing them can help solve them
7/25/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe even just saying what bothers you out loud
7/25/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes it brings new perspective
7/25/19, 10:44 - Sara: But if you are out, busy
7/25/19, 10:45 - Sara: I won’t say “eh pay attention to me”
7/25/19, 10:45 - Sara: Well, never
7/25/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I messaged you when you were out, what would you do?
7/25/19, 10:46 - Sara: Helping you if you need help, obviously
7/25/19, 10:46 - Sara: Reply you
7/25/19, 10:46 - Sara: Or telling you i’m out in case nothing serious happens
7/25/19, 10:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, I'm doing the same
7/25/19, 10:46 - Sara: But it is different
7/25/19, 10:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is it different?
7/25/19, 10:47 - Sara: My problems are less important
7/25/19, 10:47 - Sara: it can be a
7/25/19, 10:47 - Sara: I miss you and i feel like knowing about you
7/25/19, 10:48 - Sara: I’m jealous because you are having fun and i’m burried in my shit
7/25/19, 10:48 - Sara: I have issues with my ex
7/25/19, 10:48 - Sara: I have issues with myself
7/25/19, 10:48 - Sara: Silly topics
7/25/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not silly at all
7/25/19, 10:48 - Sara: Yes 😂
7/25/19, 10:49 - Sara: What can you do?
7/25/19, 10:49 - Sara: I have to learn to deal with that alone
7/25/19, 10:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least listen, maybe try offering some advice
7/25/19, 10:49 - Sara: Because people leave, not me
7/25/19, 10:49 - Sara: And ask for pitty? Uf
7/25/19, 10:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not pity, support
7/25/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I believe in you
7/25/19, 10:50 - Sara: In what sense?
7/25/19, 10:50 - Sara: That’s for weak people
7/25/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: That you can solve your problems, with or without me
7/25/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that you can be happy
7/25/19, 10:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because you deserve to be
7/25/19, 10:51 - Sara: I want to believe
7/25/19, 10:51 - Sara: But i cannot
7/25/19, 10:51 - Sara: I cannot solve problems nor be happy
7/25/19, 10:52 - Sara: But i have to
7/25/19, 10:53 - Sara: Yep, i’m hard to manage
7/25/19, 10:54 - Sara: And i really want people to help me
7/25/19, 10:54 - Sara: But i feel that it is wasting their time
7/25/19, 10:54 - Sara: Or that i’m not learning to be alone
7/25/19, 10:55 - Sara: Or independent
7/25/19, 10:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's ok to ask for help
7/25/19, 10:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to help and I never considered helping you a waste of time
7/25/19, 10:55 - Sara: But i do
7/25/19, 10:56 - Sara: I am an attention whore 😂
7/25/19, 10:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: you are going through a difficult period of your life, it's perfectly fine to search for help
7/25/19, 10:57 - Sara: People can deal with that alone
7/25/19, 10:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: really? Tell me who exactly dealt with it alone?
7/25/19, 10:58 - Sara: I’m sure everybody
7/25/19, 10:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: nonsense
7/25/19, 10:59 - Sara: Idk
7/25/19, 10:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: you want to help others, why others cannot help you?
7/25/19, 10:59 - Sara: I do not deserve it
7/25/19, 11:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: why not?
7/25/19, 11:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: why they deserve help, but not you?
7/25/19, 11:00 - Sara: I’m a mere person
7/25/19, 11:00 - Sara: I’m Sara, c’mone haha
7/25/19, 11:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: and these hypothethical they are some sort of gods?
7/25/19, 11:01 - Sara: Not at all
7/25/19, 11:01 - Sara: They are normal of course haha
7/25/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: and so are you
7/25/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: what applies to them, applies all the same to you
7/25/19, 11:02 - Sara: I don’t feel like that
7/25/19, 11:02 - Sara: Never felt like that
7/25/19, 11:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you are willing to help anybody in need you deserve to receive that all the same
7/25/19, 11:03 - Sara: Not really
7/25/19, 11:03 - Sara: It is not necessary to receive the same
7/25/19, 11:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: why, what makes you so undeserving?
7/25/19, 11:04 - Sara: Being Sara 😂
7/25/19, 11:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know about the rest but at least for me being Sara is one of the bigger reasons you deserve help
7/25/19, 11:06 - Sara: Because you are my boyfriend
7/25/19, 11:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, because being Sara means that you care about people, you genuinely want to help and not hurt anybody. Being Sara just means being a good human being
7/25/19, 11:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: and if that does not deserve help then I don't know what does
7/25/19, 11:08 - Sara: So I only deserve help because I help
7/25/19, 11:08 - Sara: Yes, probably
7/25/19, 11:08 - Sara: Not because who i am
7/25/19, 11:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: but what I just said is who you are
7/25/19, 11:10 - Sara: Are you not lying to me to make me feel good?
7/25/19, 11:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I think everybody deserves help
7/25/19, 11:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm being genuine, whether you trust me or not, it's your choice ❤
7/25/19, 11:12 - Sara: Okay
7/25/19, 11:12 - Sara: Idk
7/25/19, 11:12 - Sara: People are hypocrite
7/25/19, 11:12 - Sara: People hurt
7/25/19, 11:12 - Sara: So i feel people are lying to me constantly
7/25/19, 11:13 - Sara: How all of a sudden you think all of that about me when i’m sure you hated me when you saw me?
7/25/19, 11:13 - Sara: For the first time*
7/25/19, 11:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: how do you think is that even possible?
7/25/19, 11:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: how can I hate someone if I don't even know them
7/25/19, 11:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you really think we would be talking now if I ever hated you?
7/25/19, 11:14 - Sara: 🤷🏽‍♀
7/25/19, 11:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: and it's not all of a sudden
7/25/19, 11:15 - Sara: I don’t know anything now 😒
7/25/19, 11:16 - Sara: 😞*
7/25/19, 11:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: tell me how you feel
7/25/19, 11:16 - Sara: I don’t know
7/25/19, 11:16 - Sara: Stupid 😔
7/25/19, 11:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
7/25/19, 11:17 - Sara: I don’t know what happens to me
7/25/19, 11:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: let me help 💋
7/25/19, 11:18 - Sara: Sorry for annoying you
7/25/19, 11:18 - Sara: How? 😞
7/25/19, 11:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: however you need
7/25/19, 11:19 - Sara: I don’t know
7/25/19, 11:19 - Sara: I will edit the photos
7/25/19, 11:19 - Sara: Idk what to do
7/25/19, 11:19 - Sara: I’m sure you have to do stuff
7/25/19, 11:19 - Sara: Do it
7/25/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: not today, it's too hot to work on anything
7/25/19, 11:20 - Sara: What are you going to do?
7/25/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: later just put my cojones in water in Blaarmersen
7/25/19, 11:21 - Sara: Perfect xd
7/25/19, 11:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that's later
7/25/19, 11:21 - Sara: Nice
7/25/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: you told me before you would like to make changes to your life, I'm actually doing similar thing
7/25/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you feel like we can talk about it, maybe share some practical advice
7/25/19, 11:23 - Sara: Tell me :)
7/25/19, 11:24 - Sara: I tell you in advance i want to talk with you but i don’t feel like talking at the same time
7/25/19, 11:24 - Sara: Feel that you are here
7/25/19, 11:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: you have some time to make a call, I haven't seen you in a while? 😘
7/25/19, 11:24 - Sara: Later
7/25/19, 11:24 - Sara: I don’t feel like right now
7/25/19, 11:24 - Sara: Sorry
7/25/19, 11:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's ok
7/25/19, 11:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: tell me when you are ready
7/25/19, 11:25 - Sara: It is not because of you, i swear
7/25/19, 11:25 - Sara: But tell me
7/25/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, lately I've been feeling pretty shitty, unproductive and useless
7/25/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I started introducing small habits into my daily routine
7/25/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: to force myself to do something
7/25/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me, if I have a list of things to do, it's easier to be productive
7/25/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: small things that make me healthier, smarter, happier
7/25/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing too drastic
7/25/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I personally like to use an app on my phone called fabulous
7/25/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: if I have a list like that and it reminds me everyday about it I finally start to move my ass 😅
7/25/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: so yeah, now I try to study for at least one hour a day, read a book for also one hour
7/25/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: exercise a bit
7/25/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: it all makes me feel better about myself
7/25/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: small steps towards a bigger goal
7/25/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe that approach can work for you too
7/25/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: drastic changes to everything at the same time are unlikely to work, I think
7/25/19, 11:30 - Sara: I thought about that
7/25/19, 11:30 - Sara: But i feel what i do is senseless
7/25/19, 11:30 - Sara: Lack of motivation
7/25/19, 11:31 - Sara: Me not able to changs
7/25/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: me too, but try it
7/25/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought similarly
7/25/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's a process, not an immediate change
7/25/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't know it unless you try
7/25/19, 11:31 - Sara: I tried
7/25/19, 11:32 - Sara: I tried reading and pole dancs
7/25/19, 11:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you still do it, no?
7/25/19, 11:32 - Sara: One class left
7/25/19, 11:32 - Sara: And not reading anymore
7/25/19, 11:32 - Sara: I feel silly
7/25/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't, I tried that before our trip in april already
7/25/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: and later I failed completely
7/25/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: but now I'm trying again
7/25/19, 11:33 - Sara: Even the topics i like... i don’t feel motivated
7/25/19, 11:33 - Sara: Reading?
7/25/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: that and other small habits
7/25/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: try to make a routine
7/25/19, 11:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always try to read before sleeping
7/25/19, 11:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least 30 minutes
7/25/19, 11:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe install an app also, it helps me
7/25/19, 11:34 - Sara: But you are different
7/25/19, 11:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: how so?
7/25/19, 11:35 - Sara: Older, smarter, with power of will
7/25/19, 11:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👴
7/25/19, 11:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: anybody can change
7/25/19, 11:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you are smart
7/25/19, 11:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: power of will? I don't really have that much
7/25/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just experimented with what keeps me doing things
7/25/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me it's ticking off things on a list
7/25/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe for you it could be something different
7/25/19, 11:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: and, come on, I'm not that old 😁
7/25/19, 11:38 - Sara: If i’m going to fail and feel worse, why trying?
7/25/19, 11:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: because it's worth it
7/25/19, 11:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you know why do we fall?
7/25/19, 11:39 - Sara: Tell me
7/25/19, 11:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: So we can learn to pick ourselves up
7/25/19, 11:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Failure is a natural part of life
7/25/19, 11:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lately I've been watching some biographics of famous people
7/25/19, 11:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's amazing how many times they failed in their lives
7/25/19, 11:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: but they managed through the adversity
7/25/19, 11:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: and that's something to aspire to
7/25/19, 11:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: not trying to never fail
7/25/19, 11:42 - Sara: But they are different xD
7/25/19, 11:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: not at all
7/25/19, 11:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's impossible to tell that now
7/25/19, 11:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: when you are 80 or 90, then you can look back on your life and judge it
7/25/19, 11:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: now you have a world of possibilities
7/25/19, 11:46 - Sara: Meh
7/25/19, 11:46 - Sara: Probably
7/25/19, 11:46 - Sara: Idk
7/25/19, 11:46 - Sara: I don’t feel like that
7/25/19, 11:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Becoming a better person is not easy, it takes effort
7/25/19, 11:48 - Sara: And i’m lazy
7/25/19, 11:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: but if you never give it a shot you'll never know what could happen
7/25/19, 11:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: me too, that's why you start easy
7/25/19, 11:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: small things
7/25/19, 11:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: it really helps
7/25/19, 11:49 - Sara: I know
7/25/19, 11:49 - Sara: But even that i’m not able
7/25/19, 11:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure you are, what have you tried so far?
7/25/19, 11:49 - Sara: Yes
7/25/19, 11:50 - Sara: Reading, failed
7/25/19, 11:50 - Sara: Pole dance, about to finish
7/25/19, 11:50 - Sara: Exercises, i like them
7/25/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if pole dance counts as a small change
7/25/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you can continue, why not
7/25/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you were doing quite well so far
7/25/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: you like exercises, so you didn't fail that
7/25/19, 11:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: with reading it's a bit tricky
7/25/19, 11:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also failed on that a few times
7/25/19, 11:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's about finding the right moment to do it
7/25/19, 11:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: for me it's before sleeping
7/25/19, 11:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: for you might be different
7/25/19, 11:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: also have in mind that sometimes we simply cannot do our habits
7/25/19, 11:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: like during a trip for example
7/25/19, 11:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: or a festival
7/25/19, 11:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: and that's ok
7/25/19, 11:54 - Sara: Agree
7/25/19, 11:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember how well you organized your studying for the exams, so I'm pretty sure that you are very capable of doing it
7/25/19, 11:55 - Sara: And i failed
7/25/19, 11:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, you didn't
7/25/19, 11:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: You passed everything, no?
7/25/19, 11:56 - Sara: I failed one exam
7/25/19, 11:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, but barely and your uni accepted it so it's not really a fail
7/25/19, 11:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you had so many
7/25/19, 11:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was amazed when I saw how well organized you were
7/25/19, 11:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: never seen anything like it, it's quite great ❤
7/25/19, 11:57 - Sara: I’m not 😂
7/25/19, 11:57 - Sara: But thanks :)
7/25/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean it, my studying is always such a mess
7/25/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I could do it like you
7/25/19, 11:58 - Sara: But you has great marks
7/25/19, 11:58 - Sara: Better than me
7/25/19, 11:58 - Sara: Had*
7/25/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: not really
7/25/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end I somehow manage, but it's a mess
7/25/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: and quite stressful
7/25/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that in january I didn't go out even once
7/25/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you were studying and still finding time for that
7/25/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing short of amazing
7/25/19, 12:00 - Sara: For me it is normal
7/25/19, 12:00 - Sara: But thanks :)
7/25/19, 12:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: because you're smart
7/25/19, 12:00 - Sara: I’m not
7/25/19, 12:00 - Sara: What it being smart?
7/25/19, 12:01 - Sara: Good marks? I kill for having them and i still feel like shit
7/25/19, 12:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: marks are just a measure of knowledge
7/25/19, 12:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: knowledge is not intelligence
7/25/19, 12:02 - Sara: True
7/25/19, 12:02 - Sara: But meh
7/25/19, 12:02 - Sara: I have learnt i won’t be enough
7/25/19, 12:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: why? Enough for what?
7/25/19, 12:03 - Sara: For me
7/25/19, 12:03 - Sara: For people
7/25/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel similar, but it just pushes me to get better
7/25/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know I will never reach it but at least I can try to get as close as possible
7/25/19, 12:04 - Sara: You are great
7/25/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: for people, hmmmm...
7/25/19, 12:04 - Sara: You should not feel like that
7/25/19, 12:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: ask yourself how do you feel about other people
7/25/19, 12:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: do you think they are not enough?
7/25/19, 12:05 - Sara: I can think different than them, and viceversa
7/25/19, 12:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: because if you think that they are enough, then believe that you are enough for other people too
7/25/19, 12:05 - Sara: Not really
7/25/19, 12:06 - Sara: People can smile you and think shit about you
7/25/19, 12:06 - Sara: Or not care about you
7/25/19, 12:06 - Sara: Experience
7/25/19, 12:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course, you won't be perfect for everybody
7/25/19, 12:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: that happens, it hurts but we cannot really do much about it
7/25/19, 12:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: just move on
7/25/19, 12:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: if they don't like you, no point to keep being around them
7/25/19, 12:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't have to please everybody
7/25/19, 12:08 - Sara: I know
7/25/19, 12:08 - Sara: But ugh
7/25/19, 12:08 - Sara: As slipknot say
7/25/19, 12:08 - Sara: People = shit
7/25/19, 12:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: agreed, but hopefully not all of them
7/25/19, 12:09 - Sara: I hope
7/25/19, 12:09 - Sara: Idk now
7/25/19, 12:09 - Sara: Tomorrow i’m cuting my hair ♥
7/25/19, 12:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: goodbye, long hair 😢
7/25/19, 12:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😊
7/25/19, 12:10 - Sara: I’ll see what i do
7/25/19, 12:10 - Sara: I like my blond part
7/25/19, 12:10 - Sara: But i want to cut a lot also haha
7/25/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least I will still have pictures 😋
7/25/19, 12:12 - Sara: Why do you like a lot long hair?
7/25/19, 12:12 - Sara: Or why do you dislike me with short hair?
7/25/19, 12:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't say that, who knows, maybe I'll love it 😘
7/25/19, 12:13 - Sara: You told me i looked ugly on it
7/25/19, 12:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I just do, I think it suits you quite well
7/25/19, 12:13 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/25/19, 12:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I mentioned only the bangs
7/25/19, 12:13 - Sara: It won’t annoy in bed haha
7/25/19, 12:13 - Sara: Both
7/25/19, 12:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, then I think I didn't say it correctly, sorry
7/25/19, 12:14 - Sara: It is okay
7/25/19, 12:14 - Sara: You can say whatever you want
7/25/19, 12:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: on those pictures you sent, the rest is very nice, bangs are not my personal preference though
7/25/19, 12:14 - Sara: Okay
7/25/19, 12:15 - Sara: It is fine
7/25/19, 12:15 - Sara: You’ll tell me
7/25/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: in the end, whatever will make you happy, I'll be perfectly fine with

7/25/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course
7/25/19, 12:16 - Sara: Thanks

7/25/19, 12:17 - Sara: At what time are you going?
7/25/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't know yet

7/25/19, 12:33 - Sara: Maybe my attitude
7/25/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm being realistic, I know that I'm not some sort of wizard and I won't help you very much by just talking
7/25/19, 12:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'll try anyway
7/25/19, 12:35 - Sara: Of course you help
7/25/19, 12:35 - Sara: But i am fucking stubborn

7/25/19, 12:43 - Sara: You have better things to do
7/25/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: You think that only because you don't value yourself

7/25/19, 14:52 - Sara: True
7/25/19, 14:52 - Sara: That reminds me to a saying we say about Cuenca
7/25/19, 14:53 - Sara: I’ll copy paste
7/25/19, 14:53 - Sara: TO SHOW SOMEONE WHERE CUENCA IS: Legend has it King Philip The Handsome of Spain (1478-1506) had an observatory built for him to look out at cities surrounding Madrid on the horizon. It also doubled up as a love nest where he could keep his affairs hidden away from his wife Juana The Mad. As he escorted one young lady up the tower, he reportedly told guards “la voy a poner mirando a Cuenca”. They read between the lines and popularized the expression with its new hidden meaning: to have sex 'doggy style'.
7/25/19, 14:53 - Sara: Now I'm horny xD
7/25/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: My work is here is done than 💋

7/25/19, 17:18 - Sara: Why you feel like that?
7/25/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I'm not good at dancing and I feel very self conscious about it

7/25/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I still don't feel comfortable

7/25/19, 17:23 - Sara: Dance steps

7/25/19, 19:05 - Sara: Hahahaha 🌧 🐰
7/25/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: What exercises are you doing?
7/25/19, 19:05 - Sara: Now push ups
7/25/19, 19:05 - Sara: They are the same as always
7/25/19, 19:05 - Sara: Little by little
7/25/19, 19:05 - Sara: After a week, i don’t want to excess
7/25/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Great 😁
7/25/19, 19:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you remember to stretch?
7/25/19, 19:06 - Sara: Yesss daddy
7/25/19, 19:06 - Sara: I have done it :p
7/25/19, 19:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/25/19, 19:06 - Sara: After finishing, i’ll do it as well
7/25/19, 19:06 - Sara: Nice sky
7/25/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly what I was going to say
7/25/19, 19:07 - Sara: I know :)
7/25/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: How long do you stretch?
7/25/19, 19:08 - Sara: 5 minutes xd
7/25/19, 19:08 - Sara: I should do more, right?
7/25/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so
7/25/19, 19:09 - Sara: How much time do you do?
7/25/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's great if you become more flexible but most importantly it is to avoid injuries
7/25/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: 10 minutes at least
7/25/19, 19:09 - Sara: Really? Damn
7/25/19, 19:10 - Sara: That is a lot :/
7/25/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not that much, come on
7/25/19, 19:10 - Sara: For me it is
7/25/19, 19:10 - Sara: I want to exercise asap haha
7/25/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, then do 5 before and 10 after
7/25/19, 19:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: How much do you stretch in pole dance?
7/25/19, 19:11 - Sara: 30 minutes before and 5 after
7/25/19, 19:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, that makes sense
7/25/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stretching before is more important
7/25/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if you want to be more flexible, both are important
7/25/19, 19:13 - Sara: Yep
7/25/19, 19:14 - Sara: Is it worth being flexible?
7/25/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so
7/25/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everything becomes a bit easier
7/25/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: For pole dance I think it's pretty much a must
7/25/19, 19:15 - Sara: Yes
7/25/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: It helps in other sports too
7/25/19, 19:15 - Sara: About sports idk what to do
7/25/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Also sex~
7/25/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel like you definitely should stretch as much as possible
7/25/19, 19:16 - Sara: Thinking the same
7/25/19, 19:16 - Sara: Should i go to gym next month or with these exercises on my own are okay?
7/25/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends what you want to achieve
7/25/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think on your own is great for starting, to just get used to exercising, make it a habit
7/25/19, 19:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at some point to progress further gym could be useful
7/25/19, 19:18 - Sara: Starting? I’m not a mere amateur... i have going to the gym for 4 years each summer
7/25/19, 19:18 - Sara: So please, Kamil
7/25/19, 19:18 - Sara: Don’t call me noob
7/25/19, 19:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only summer?
7/25/19, 19:18 - Sara: 🌚
7/25/19, 19:18 - Sara: During the course is very hard xd
7/25/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I know but the point would be to exercise all the time
7/25/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: So exercising at home can be very nice for that
7/25/19, 19:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: And by starting I meant like starting to do it more regularly
7/25/19, 19:20 - Sara: I’ll think
7/25/19, 19:20 - Sara: Because i want to be stronger, thinner, more resistant, elastic
7/25/19, 19:20 - Sara: Idk
7/25/19, 19:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Elastic can definitely be done at home
7/25/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: For stretching you don't need any equipment
7/25/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: The rest probably also
7/25/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I would need to think about it a bit more
7/25/19, 19:22 - Sara: Why?
7/25/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stretching is pretty straightforward
7/25/19, 19:22 - Sara: I think going to the gym results are going to be faster
7/25/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exercising for strength, weight loss and that sort of thing are a bit more complex
7/25/19, 19:23 - Sara: Yep
7/25/19, 19:23 - Sara: I don’t know why i am getting now less motivated when i should not 😂
7/25/19, 19:23 - Sara: I really like my body when i go to the gym
7/25/19, 19:23 - Sara: But idk if this is possible for me
7/25/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course it is
7/25/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everybody can improve
7/25/19, 19:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/25/19, 19:24 - Sara: I don’t see it in myself 🙁
7/25/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You just sent me a picture in which you think you looked better
7/25/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: So why it would be impossible to do it again
7/25/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or get even better
7/25/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw ♥️♥️♥️
7/25/19, 19:26 - Sara: I wish
7/25/19, 19:26 - Sara: Thank :)
7/25/19, 19:26 - Sara: It was like 3 years ago
7/25/19, 19:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/25/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, there are limits to what we can achieve but only professionals get close to reaching them
7/25/19, 19:27 - Sara: Btw, i’ll be recording some videos for instagram in case i don’t answer soon
7/25/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can do it if you really commit to it
7/25/19, 19:27 - Sara: I know
7/25/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😎
7/25/19, 19:27 - Sara: But even the simplest
7/25/19, 19:28 - Sara: I’ll try but meh
7/25/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just keep going, the results will follow, you'll see 😘
7/25/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: (and hopefully I'll see too 🌚)
7/25/19, 19:29 - Sara: Do you see them in you?
7/25/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I only started exercising again recently so not yet
7/25/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, actually results of stretching, yes
7/25/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: As for the rest, I need to improve my diet first
7/25/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm just exercising to get used to it
7/25/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: After I go home I plan to start running again and go to the swimming pool
7/25/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then I can tell you if I get the results
7/25/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: For now, results are not the objective
7/25/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Results like more muscle or slimmer I mean
7/25/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Actually my grip strength improved significantly since I bought the device for training it
7/25/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But only that for now, I think
7/25/19, 19:34 - Sara: Which ones?
7/25/19, 19:34 - Sara: Great :)
7/25/19, 19:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stronger, faster, slimmer
7/25/19, 19:36 - Sara: Okay..
7/25/19, 19:36 - Sara: I have info about my knee

7/25/19, 19:38 - Sara: But i want to see you
7/25/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your health is the priority
7/25/19, 19:38 - Sara: But 😣
7/25/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I figure something out
7/25/19, 19:38 - Sara: Ugh

7/26/19, 10:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
7/26/19, 10:33 - Sara: As you, having my bottle always next to me

7/26/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/26/19, 13:24 - Sara: Gay for the child i can have
7/26/19, 13:24 - Sara: But that is perfect :3
7/26/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool, so we can make gay children to sell them
7/26/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you think they would be worth more?
7/26/19, 13:25 - Sara: Perfect business
7/26/19, 13:25 - Sara: Of course ♥ it is fashionable being gay now
7/26/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👌
7/26/19, 13:26 - Sara: We are a great team 🖐
7/26/19, 13:26 - Sara: What i like is that everybody makes jokes about that, it is a great progress
7/26/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, it sounds so ridiculous that even conservatives cannot take it seriously
7/26/19, 13:27 - Sara: I’m sure
7/26/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm a little bit sad because the plan was perfect
7/26/19, 13:27 - Sara: I believe in what he says
7/26/19, 13:28 - Sara: C’mone, his face is trust-worthy
7/26/19, 13:28 - Sara: Btw, can i ask you something?
7/26/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Go on
7/26/19, 13:28 - Sara: About studying
7/26/19, 13:28 - Sara: I’m reading the book and i’m learning things
7/26/19, 13:29 - Sara: So idk if writing them to learn it or what
7/26/19, 13:29 - Sara: I’m only marking the page where the info is
7/26/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Writing who?
7/26/19, 13:30 - Sara: The things i’m learning
7/26/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok
7/26/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I do that sometimes
7/26/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But mostly a short version
7/26/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: More like something to look up if I forget
7/26/19, 13:31 - Sara: True
7/26/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yeah, definitely a good idea
7/26/19, 13:31 - Sara: But idk if i will look up for it later or not
7/26/19, 13:31 - Sara: Do you think so?
7/26/19, 13:32 - Sara: Okay, like this book is quite introductory but the ideas are displayed very divulgative and understandable
7/26/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can write it anyway, I remember things better if I write them down, even if I don't use these notes later
7/26/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe for you would be similar
7/26/19, 13:32 - Sara: I’ll try
7/26/19, 13:32 - Sara: Also i have notes from conferences i have been in uni
7/26/19, 13:33 - Sara: I’ll try
7/26/19, 13:33 - Sara: Merci beacoup 💜
7/26/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: So sexual

7/26/19, 13:35 - Sara: Idk if studying english as well
7/26/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's great that you're doing it, good job ❤️
7/26/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw something else I use for studying is an app called forest
7/26/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It helps me focus on studying
7/26/19, 13:36 - Sara: Sounds familiar
7/26/19, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can set the time you want to focus on something and then plant a virtual tree that will die if you start using other websites, apps and that sort of thing
7/26/19, 13:38 - Sara: Hahahaha aw poor trees
7/26/19, 13:38 - Sara: Seems nice
7/26/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also you receive coins for each time you succeed
7/26/19, 13:38 - Sara: Aw, i’m seeing my notebook
7/26/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you can use them to plant real trees
7/26/19, 13:38 - Sara: Yeeah, many people use it
7/26/19, 13:38 - Sara: I have very interesting notes about prostitution, antiespecism and voluntary work
7/26/19, 13:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😎👌
7/26/19, 13:39 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/26/19, 13:39 - Sara: Maybe i can re read it
7/26/19, 13:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably a good idea, message from past Sara to the new Sara
7/26/19, 13:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😊
7/26/19, 13:40 - Sara: Well, i have my personal notebook since 2009 or something like that
7/26/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Messages from newborn Sara 😂
7/26/19, 13:41 - Sara: Hahahahha
7/26/19, 13:41 - Sara: 11 year old Sara xd
7/26/19, 13:41 - Sara: Now i write less
7/26/19, 13:41 - Sara: I should not stop
7/26/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It can be another habit to make
7/26/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like reading
7/26/19, 13:42 - Sara: But writing everyday..
7/26/19, 13:42 - Sara: Maybe about my feelings
7/26/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not necessarily everyday
7/26/19, 13:42 - Sara: Probably that can improve everything
7/26/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, agreed
7/26/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yeah it could be maybe once a week
7/26/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: For example on the very end of the week
7/26/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Writing about how was your week
7/26/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or something completely different, however you feel like
7/26/19, 13:44 - Sara: I’ll try
7/26/19, 13:44 - Sara: But uff
7/26/19, 13:44 - Sara: Too many things to doo haha
7/26/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can wait with that until you get used to the things you are doing now
7/26/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: No rush
7/26/19, 13:45 - Sara: True
7/26/19, 13:45 - Sara: But yay, i want to improve
7/26/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Patience, young padawan

7/26/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/26/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I set time for studying but it's not so much so that I can also go out if I feel like
7/26/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: One, two or even 3 hours of studying is not going to kill your social life, come on
7/26/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I set myself goals that for one hour I will study just that one topic, nothing else
7/26/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: It definitely helps
7/26/19, 13:54 - Sara: Sure?
7/26/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I just jump between different things I don't learn much
7/26/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's my opinion, is it correct, I don't know, it works for me
7/26/19, 13:56 - Sara: So study only one topic per day?
7/26/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I try to focus on one topic per hour
7/26/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it can be done differently
7/26/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Per day is also fine
7/26/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I try to study 2-3 hours a day now
7/26/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I also have a lot of time now
7/26/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later I might have to adjust
7/26/19, 13:59 - Sara: Yes
7/26/19, 13:59 - Sara: Sounds reasonabls

7/26/19, 15:42 - Sara: Oh...
7/26/19, 15:42 - Sara: How do you feel?
7/26/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: weird

7/26/19, 15:49 - Sara: That you had this opportunity and experience
7/26/19, 15:49 - Sara: In my case, erasmus saved my life
7/26/19, 15:49 - Sara: Of course being sad is normal when we are happy in a place or in a moment with people when we have to leave
7/26/19, 15:50 - Sara: But look forward, babe, you have a lot of new memories to collect ♥
7/26/19, 18:01 - Sara: btw, i like this kind of dance ❤ I hope i can do it someday https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEsofW-h6zA

7/26/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was reading, the sun finally hid behind the buildings so it's starting to be more bearable
7/26/19, 18:05 - Sara: Goood

7/26/19, 18:07 - Sara: But drums let me exhausted
7/26/19, 18:07 - Sara: It is a physical and a physical effort
7/26/19, 18:08 - Sara: In 30 minutes focused i die

7/26/19, 18:09 - Sara: :p
7/26/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: have you considered going to the swimming pool more regularly?
7/26/19, 18:09 - Sara: Ummmm yes
7/26/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: since running is not the best option now?
7/26/19, 18:09 - Sara: But i’m afraid of the operation
7/26/19, 18:10 - Sara: Like paying for the gym and then not goinf because i have to do the surgery
7/26/19, 18:10 - Sara: But yes, it is very recommendable
7/26/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, I understand
7/26/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I guess for now you don't necessarily need to buy a membership or something like that

7/26/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, I want to help and I will but I believe that you are strong enough to do it on your own too, you just need to believe in yourself ❤
7/26/19, 18:16 - Sara: Thanks mi amor 💕

7/26/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably all of it
7/26/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've already learned a bit about modern history of Spain but not very in depth
7/26/19, 19:25 - Sara: Tell me more
7/26/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just the civil war, second world War and after
7/26/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: But not very much
7/26/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to at least have some sort of idea what you were talking about
7/26/19, 19:27 - Sara: Me? When? Hahaha
7/26/19, 19:27 - Sara: It is very important nowadays, yes
7/26/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: You, Cristina, sometimes you were mentioning Franco
7/26/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: And obviously it had massive influence on modern Spain

7/26/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm starting from the very beginning
7/26/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Book has 2000 pages so it will take me some time

7/26/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Italian sound nice, French sounds awful
7/26/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: And if we get rid of France than we can have more Germany
7/26/19, 19:39 - Sara: German sounds also nice?
7/26/19, 19:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, but it's a more acceptable country than France
7/26/19, 19:39 - Sara: True

7/26/19, 19:43 - Sara: Well

7/26/19, 21:05 - Sara: Love you 💋
7/26/19, 21:48 - Sara: Ha ha ha
7/26/19, 21:49 - Sara: Tomorrow i’m going to a party
7/26/19, 21:49 - Sara: And guess who is coming :)
7/26/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you sure you want to go?
7/26/19, 21:50 - Sara: Yes
7/26/19, 21:50 - Sara: He asked if she can come
7/26/19, 21:50 - Sara: I prefer not to answer
7/26/19, 21:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if he's back from the trip than soon you should tell him about your decision
7/26/19, 21:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that this is quite hard, if you need to talk, I'm here for you 🌹
7/26/19, 21:53 - Sara: I won’t tell him anything as soon as he is with her
7/26/19, 21:53 - Sara: That is not polite
7/26/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, that's not what I meant
7/26/19, 21:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is between the two of you and it's a bad idea to get her involved
7/26/19, 21:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But soon nonetheless
7/26/19, 21:54 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/26/19, 21:54 - Sara: I’ll see
7/26/19, 21:55 - Sara: I will ignore
7/26/19, 21:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, seems fine for now

7/26/19, 22:00 - Sara: Have fun 🤩🤩🤩
7/26/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand, can I help somehow?
7/26/19, 22:00 - Sara: It is okay
7/26/19, 22:00 - Sara: I will forget while watching the concert
7/26/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, if you need something don't hesitate to text me ❤️

7/26/19, 23:24 - Sara: “i prefer being a sassy bitch than being depressed” Sara de la Torre, 2019
7/26/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it is one way to deal with it 😎
7/26/19, 23:52 - Sara: Better than crying in the bathroom xD
7/26/19, 23:52 - Sara: Tomorrow is going to be a curious day xD
7/26/19, 23:52 - Sara: How is it going?

7/26/19, 23:57 - Sara: 💋
7/26/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: We moved to the stage with much better music, so yeah, definitely ❤️
7/27/19, 00:05 - Sara: Coool
7/27/19, 00:05 - Sara: This bands... meh
7/27/19, 00:05 - Sara: Sound acceptable
7/27/19, 00:05 - Sara: These*
7/27/19, 00:06 - Sara: But at least it is live music ♥
7/27/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, here they just play famous songs
7/27/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing original
7/27/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yeah, it's also live and that's always nice
7/27/19, 00:10 - Sara: Here the drummer was standing doing nothing while a drum back track sounded and inwas like ???
7/27/19, 00:10 - Sara: These are originals
7/27/19, 00:11 - Sara: I hope they sing something by jon bovi

7/27/19, 00:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you sure? 🌝
7/27/19, 00:13 - Sara: Depending on what you consider melons 🌚
7/27/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, there are two options and in your case  I consider all of them melons
7/27/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍈
7/27/19, 00:15 - Sara: So everything is good
7/27/19, 00:15 - Sara: I would consider everything as grapes but okay ;p
7/27/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also great, so still fine ❤️
7/27/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also does it actually matter which melons? 🌚
7/27/19, 00:22 - Sara: I like bananas
7/27/19, 00:22 - Sara: That is what matters :)
7/27/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough 😁
7/27/19, 00:24 - Sara: 🍑
7/27/19, 00:24 - Sara: Hahahahaha :p
7/27/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍌
7/27/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🥟
7/27/19, 00:24 - Sara: Pieroggi of banana ♥ my dream
7/27/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a banana, you have pierogi
7/27/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can combine
7/27/19, 00:28 - Sara: Let’s do it quick 🎶
7/27/19, 00:28 - Sara: How? 🤔
7/27/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: 14 hours on train 😭
7/27/19, 00:37 - Sara: 😩😩😩😩
7/27/19, 00:37 - Sara: I hope we can see eachother soon
7/27/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, 14 hours is not that much
7/27/19, 01:14 - Sara: If the reason is good enough
7/27/19, 01:14 - Sara: ♥
7/27/19, 01:14 - Sara: I’m at home already
7/27/19, 01:14 - Sara: Tomorrow night is going to be intense :p
7/27/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still at the festival but I'm feeling tired so I might go home soon
7/27/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you ok?
7/27/19, 01:15 - Sara: I’m better
7/27/19, 01:15 - Sara: But i feel uncertainty about tomorrow
7/27/19, 01:16 - Sara: What about you?
7/27/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just tired right now
7/27/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
7/27/19, 01:16 - Sara: Partying hard?
7/27/19, 01:17 - Sara: Gosh i want to dance with you so much and twerk you until your hips disapear
7/27/19, 01:17 - Sara: Idk how to act, what to feel when i appear and see them
7/27/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm know it's going to be hard, you should probably give them space
7/27/19, 01:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much reason to be close
7/27/19, 01:18 - Sara: In what sense? Me not going?
7/27/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, no
7/27/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just when you're there
7/27/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where will be the party?
7/27/19, 01:19 - Sara: In a friend’s house
7/27/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, so not really a lot of space probably?
7/27/19, 01:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 01:20 - Sara: Nop
7/27/19, 01:20 - Sara: Well, me being outside the house
7/27/19, 01:20 - Sara: He lives in a cottage
7/27/19, 01:21 - Sara: So yep
7/27/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not really sure how to help you with that, I've never encountered anything similar
7/27/19, 01:21 - Sara: It is okay
7/27/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel bad tomorrow, call me
7/27/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or text me
7/27/19, 01:22 - Sara: I feel your support ♥
7/27/19, 01:22 - Sara: Okay babe
7/27/19, 01:22 - Sara: Thanks for everything
7/27/19, 01:22 - Sara: I’ll try to be good
7/27/19, 01:22 - Sara: 😎
7/27/19, 01:23 - Sara: I’ll dress as the best super model
7/27/19, 01:23 - Sara: It is a mechanism to feel better with myself
7/27/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you want to appear better than her, make him regret or something?
7/27/19, 01:24 - Sara: It is a general thing i do
7/27/19, 01:24 - Sara: Just feel that i’m something
7/27/19, 01:24 - Sara: Looking good makes me confidence
7/27/19, 01:25 - Sara: But the first thing is a good approach. The second one, not at all
7/27/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You always look good ❤️
7/27/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it good?
7/27/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You really shouldn't compare yourself
7/27/19, 01:26 - Sara: Thanks :3
7/27/19, 01:26 - Sara: Not good, but you were righf
7/27/19, 01:26 - Sara: I know but... i cannot avoid it
7/27/19, 01:27 - Sara: Why he treats her better, and not me? Why is he proud of here and not of me
7/27/19, 01:27 - Sara: Feeling that i don’t deserve that
7/27/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's because you didn't deserve to be treated that way
7/27/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nobody does
7/27/19, 01:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 01:28 - Sara: But idk if it is because he is more mature now, he loves her more now than he used to love me
7/27/19, 01:28 - Sara: If he was mistaken
7/27/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know him and your relationship so I cannot tell you that
7/27/19, 01:29 - Sara: Just questions with no answer
7/27/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whatever the reason it's a pretty bad thing to do
7/27/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: He made mistakes, you shouldn't let those mistakes affect you
7/27/19, 01:29 - Sara: What?
7/27/19, 01:30 - Sara: And should i judge him for that? Should i feel bad for that?
7/27/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Treating you like that
7/27/19, 01:30 - Sara: I’m just happier without knowing about him
7/27/19, 01:30 - Sara: Idk if i’m the one exaggerating
7/27/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that's a good thing
7/27/19, 01:30 - Sara: But i feel it
7/27/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: At this point it's not very useful to keep thinking about it
7/27/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: It happened, there is not much anybody can do now
7/27/19, 01:31 - Sara: True...
7/27/19, 01:31 - Sara: Does he deserve that?
7/27/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are your own person, you define your worth
7/27/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's not for me to judge
7/27/19, 01:31 - Sara: 😅
7/27/19, 01:32 - Sara: Idk... i’m afraid of his reaction
7/27/19, 01:32 - Sara: It will be weird seeing them together
7/27/19, 01:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: You still care about him, don't you?
7/27/19, 01:32 - Sara: After he making me like shit
7/27/19, 01:32 - Sara: Idk
7/27/19, 01:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Remember, you are awesome 😘
7/27/19, 01:33 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/27/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: If someone doesn't appreciate it, that's their problem, not yours
7/27/19, 01:34 - Sara: If people hates me or treat me bad is for a reason, or not?
7/27/19, 01:34 - Sara: Idk whose fault is it
7/27/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Difficult question, difficult to generalize
7/27/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would need to know specifics
7/27/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes people are just jealous
7/27/19, 01:36 - Sara: I am, and i’m not proud
7/27/19, 01:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's understandable, I cannot even imagine how it must feel to be with someone so long
7/27/19, 01:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not something to be proud of but also perfectly understandable
7/27/19, 01:38 - Sara: And realizing about everything latsd
7/27/19, 01:38 - Sara: Is it?
7/27/19, 01:38 - Sara: I just want to be... appreciated
7/27/19, 01:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I appreciate you ❤️
7/27/19, 01:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it is, feelings don't just disappear
7/27/19, 01:39 - Sara: I hope
7/27/19, 01:39 - Sara: Thanks my love ♥
7/27/19, 01:39 - Sara: I feel that very few people do it
7/27/19, 01:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe few great friends is all you need 🌹
7/27/19, 01:41 - Sara: How is your situation with that?
7/27/19, 01:41 - Sara: I finally feel i’m not a weirdo when it comes to my feelings
7/27/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar, I never expected to have many great friends
7/27/19, 01:41 - Sara: I thought i was selfish
7/27/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: A few that I can trust is really enough
7/27/19, 01:42 - Sara: Do you have them?
7/27/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not completely sure
7/27/19, 01:42 - Sara: Why?
7/27/19, 01:43 - Sara: ~you’ll always have me~
7/27/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's difficult to say sometimes, I don't get very close with people easily
7/27/19, 01:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have colleagues and friends but someone actually close?
7/27/19, 01:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe just you
7/27/19, 01:44 - Sara: What do you consider close?
7/27/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can comfortably talk about my problems and feelings, that's probably what I would consider close
7/27/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And vice versa of course
7/27/19, 01:45 - Sara: ❤
7/27/19, 01:46 - Sara: It is really a privilege for me having this opportunity
7/27/19, 01:46 - Sara: But you can trust your people around you
7/27/19, 01:46 - Sara: What i’m doing now is seeing my contact list
7/27/19, 01:46 - Sara: I put a heart in the name of the people i can really trust when i need help
7/27/19, 01:47 - Sara: And I put a star in the name of the people when i want to trust when i need help
7/27/19, 01:47 - Sara: And of course people who i can go out with in a more intimate way (in groups is easly)
7/27/19, 01:47 - Sara: You realize like that who is really there
7/27/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: No matter how many you have, I think it's important to appreciate each one
7/27/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because this is something really beautiful
7/27/19, 01:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And not very common, in my opinion
7/27/19, 01:49 - Sara: Of course, i mark them to see it when i feel alone
7/27/19, 01:49 - Sara: What exactly?
7/27/19, 01:49 - Sara: And i have marked very few people
7/27/19, 01:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, but you have them, I believe that that is enough
7/27/19, 01:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: You shouldn't feel bad that there are few of them
7/27/19, 01:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because that level of intimacy is not something easy to achieve
7/27/19, 01:51 - Sara: Not at all
7/27/19, 01:51 - Sara: But i love to have it
7/27/19, 01:51 - Sara: I think you, my sister and christian arr the only ones who have it
7/27/19, 01:51 - Sara: So yes, so nice ❤
7/27/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, think you're quite lucky to have such an amazing sister and a great friend like Christian
7/27/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Feel good about it
7/27/19, 01:52 - Sara: I am :)
7/27/19, 01:53 - Sara: And having you as a caring, funny, lovely boyfriend
7/27/19, 01:53 - Sara: Do not forget
7/27/19, 01:53 - Sara: ♥
7/27/19, 01:53 - Sara: I’m very blessed if i think this carefully
7/27/19, 01:53 - Sara: I cannot stop repeating this
7/27/19, 01:54 - Sara: But i’m veeeery proud of you and of your progress
7/27/19, 01:55 - Sara: Although there are moments i feel like we have to know each other more (solution: tests 🌝), there have been situations where i felt we were so close, a reslly beautiful connection
7/27/19, 01:56 - Sara: And you should give people the opportunity to let them know such a wonderful polaco 💕
7/27/19, 01:56 - Sara: I love you 3000 😚😉
7/27/19, 01:57 - Sara: I really want to hug you, hold your hand and having our feet in the wall ~,and make love whole night~
7/27/19, 01:58 - Sara: :,)
7/27/19, 02:01 - Sara: I think i’ll go to sleep
7/27/19, 02:02 - Sara: You must be in the festival while i am being so emotional 😂 sorry
7/27/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, we started walking, I couldn't answer
7/27/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's really beautiful,❤️❤️❤️
7/27/19, 02:03 - Sara: It is okay :)
7/27/19, 02:03 - Sara: Guess who is beautiful

7/27/19, 10:07 - Sara: Why are you so cute? 💕😭
7/27/19, 10:07 - Sara: :)
7/27/19, 10:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just went to the festival
7/27/19, 10:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, this is now, right?
7/27/19, 10:08 - Sara: Yes
7/27/19, 10:08 - Sara: And anything else? What did you see there?
7/27/19, 10:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: We were walking around from stage to stage
7/27/19, 10:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ainara got drunk
7/27/19, 10:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
7/27/19, 10:09 - Sara: And how was it? XD
7/27/19, 10:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tbh, not so great, in most cases I didn't like the music very much
7/27/19, 10:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And in a few places where I did it was so full of people that it was impossible to get anywhere near
7/27/19, 10:10 - Sara: What genre?
7/27/19, 10:10 - Sara: Yes... that is the worst
7/27/19, 10:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: One place dissapointed me because they were playing killing in the name when we arrived so we stayed
7/27/19, 10:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But after that they started playing other stuff
7/27/19, 10:11 - Sara: I used to play that song ♥ it was fucking insane
7/27/19, 10:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like Britney Spears or take on me 😂
7/27/19, 10:11 - Sara: Buuuuu, but was it rock?
7/27/19, 10:11 - Sara: Eh eh EH
7/27/19, 10:12 - Sara: Don’t complain about those hits
7/27/19, 10:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, they weren't so bad, but still, transition from rock to something dissapointed me a little 😂
7/27/19, 10:13 - Sara: Well, there is a bar in Toledo like that
7/27/19, 10:13 - Sara: First they play metal and rock, and after 01h they play reggaeton and pop hits 😂
7/27/19, 10:13 - Sara: I love it hahaha
7/27/19, 10:13 - Sara: So plan for today?
7/27/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably just going to the festival again
7/27/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm not very happy there tbh
7/27/19, 10:14 - Sara: It finishes tomorrow right?
7/27/19, 10:14 - Sara: Why not? :(
7/27/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
7/27/19, 10:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not in the mood to party, tbh
7/27/19, 10:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also I see people around, hugging, kissing and I miss you 💋
7/27/19, 10:15 - Sara: Aw ♥
7/27/19, 10:15 - Sara: Missing you too babe
7/27/19, 10:15 - Sara: I wish i could be there
7/27/19, 10:16 - Sara: But you should enjoy the company you have
7/27/19, 10:17 - Sara: And you are also in the festival! :D
7/27/19, 10:17 - Sara: https://twitter.com/usatodaylife/status/1154787642736893953?s=12
7/27/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw Eva keeps asking me about you ☺️
7/27/19, 10:17 - Sara: Awww really? ♥
7/27/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: She thinks we're cute together and that we fit each other ❤️
7/27/19, 10:18 - Sara: I remember her getting nearer in the kitchen
7/27/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ainara also actually ask about you
7/27/19, 10:18 - Sara: And asking whispering about you 😂♥
7/27/19, 10:18 - Sara: 💕 i agree
7/27/19, 10:18 - Sara: ❤❤
7/27/19, 10:19 - Sara: Oh please🥰
7/27/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I begin to like her ☺️
7/27/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yesterday we went to one concert and there was a guy on the stage with really great abs
7/27/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think she fell in love 😂
7/27/19, 10:20 - Sara: Eva? 😂
7/27/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But later she complained that he didn't move his hips enough 🤣
7/27/19, 10:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
7/27/19, 10:20 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂😂
7/27/19, 10:20 - Sara: I would complain about the same xD
7/27/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: So thirsty...
7/27/19, 10:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂😂😂
7/27/19, 10:21 - Sara: 👅
7/27/19, 10:21 - Sara: Always
7/27/19, 10:21 - Sara: Hahahaha
7/27/19, 10:21 - Sara: Btw, Aitor is not going with you?
7/27/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Haven't seen him since Copacabana
7/27/19, 10:22 - Sara: Really? That is weird
7/27/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, maybe he's going out with his other friends
7/27/19, 10:22 - Sara: Probably, with the belgian ones
7/27/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: If he's happy, that's all that matters
7/27/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm not getting completely drunk
7/27/19, 10:23 - Sara: Of course ☺
7/27/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's a nice bonus 😂
7/27/19, 10:23 - Sara: Do you want? Xd
7/27/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, not at all
7/27/19, 10:24 - Sara: Better
7/27/19, 10:24 - Sara: I’m reconsidering the idea of drinking alcohol
7/27/19, 10:25 - Sara: Or limiting it a lot, i’ll see
7/27/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Getting wasted, definitely no, tipsy, seems fine to me
7/27/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: So yeah, just limited a lot
7/27/19, 10:26 - Sara: For any reason?
7/27/19, 10:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I want to have fun, if I'm tipsy that's possible (also without drinking), if I'm wasted I just suffer
7/27/19, 10:27 - Sara: Without drinking? How is that possible?
7/27/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Difficult 😂
7/27/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very difficult
7/27/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy difícil
7/27/19, 10:28 - Sara: Ohh
7/27/19, 10:29 - Sara: Si you cannot do it?
7/27/19, 10:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on a situation
7/27/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: If a place is not really that great it's hard to enjoy it
7/27/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also depends on the mood
7/27/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like now, it's a bit difficult for me
7/27/19, 10:31 - Sara: :(
7/27/19, 10:32 - Sara: You should find even the simplest things that makes you happy in the moment
7/27/19, 10:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but it's much easier to find things that upset me so still, pretty difficult
7/27/19, 10:33 - Sara: Well i understand you
7/27/19, 10:33 - Sara: How are you feeling now?
7/27/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure, just neutral I guess
7/27/19, 10:35 - Sara: What are you doing now?
7/27/19, 10:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Breakfast
7/27/19, 10:37 - Sara: Nice
7/27/19, 10:37 - Sara: Do i interrupt?
7/27/19, 10:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope ☺️
7/27/19, 10:37 - Sara: Okaay
7/27/19, 10:38 - Sara: I am reading and taking notes
7/27/19, 10:38 - Sara: 😎
7/27/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your book?
7/27/19, 10:39 - Sara: Yes
7/27/19, 10:39 - Sara: Now it is about the different feminist waves
7/27/19, 10:39 - Sara: Most of the stuff or i knew it or i learnt it in ghent ☺
7/27/19, 10:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool 😎
7/27/19, 10:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: And are you going with your father and sister?
7/27/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yesterday you got rid of feminist waves 😂
7/27/19, 10:41 - Sara: Idk... i don’t feel like
7/27/19, 10:41 - Sara: And my sister is not awake
7/27/19, 10:41 - Sara: What do you mean

7/27/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: being relaxed sound good, try to do that ❤

7/27/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, I'm fine
7/27/19, 10:50 - Sara: Nice :)
7/27/19, 10:51 - Sara: I feel like an antisocial here reading and the rest talking xD
7/27/19, 10:51 - Sara: I’ll talk to them, then continue reading
7/27/19, 10:51 - Sara: This part is quite interesting, radical feminism
7/27/19, 10:51 - Sara: I need to learn about what i defend 😂🥰

7/27/19, 14:09 - Sara: Just playing
7/27/19, 14:09 - Sara: I want to record something singing also ♥
7/27/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you make a video?
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: You?
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: Yess 💜
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: Now? Or me singing?
7/27/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: It started to rain a lot now, so I'm just at home for now
7/27/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Both?
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: Really? Damn
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: I’ll try :)
7/27/19, 14:10 - Sara: Here weather is lower so it is great
7/27/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not really complaining, it's colder now here so that's great 😊
7/27/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like summer rain
7/27/19, 14:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 14:13 - Sara: This was for a friend, but it is fucking horrible haha
7/27/19, 14:13 - Sara: ♥
7/27/19, 14:13 - Sara: And are you doing something now?
7/27/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I actually took a nap, I was feeling pretty tired
7/27/19, 14:14 - Sara: You did not sleep too much
7/27/19, 14:14 - Sara: Understandable :)
7/27/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's recorded with the phone so of course the sound quality is not great
7/27/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: but the song itself is nice
7/27/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: what is it?
7/27/19, 14:15 - Sara: Thanks
7/27/19, 14:15 - Sara: Volver a disfrutar - El canto del loco
7/27/19, 14:15 - Sara: Completely improvised xd
7/27/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's just you and your sister?
7/27/19, 14:20 - Sara: Yes hahaha
7/27/19, 14:20 - Sara: Also she wrote a song
7/27/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: cool 😎
7/27/19, 14:20 - Sara: And i was composing the drums for her
7/27/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: more cool 😎
7/27/19, 14:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 14:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 14:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: so metal ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
7/27/19, 14:28 - Sara: Not metal at all hahaha it is called Insurreccion bu Manolo Garcia, you can like it
7/27/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara, please
7/27/19, 14:28 - Sara: Tell me
7/27/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know it's not metal
7/27/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😆
7/27/19, 14:29 - Sara: Hahahaha okay okay
7/27/19, 14:29 - Sara: I don’t see here your irony
7/27/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's why I don't like text messages that much
7/27/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: it doesn't give me enough freedom to express it
7/27/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I did like it, and I liked Californication even more ❤
7/27/19, 14:31 - Sara: Rt
7/27/19, 14:31 - Sara: Really you liked it? Be honest :
7/27/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: of course it could use some work but I did, honestly
7/27/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: especially californication
7/27/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I just like that song so maybe I'm a bit biased ❤❤❤ (and I kind of like the singer 🌝)
7/27/19, 14:33 - Sara: 🌝
7/27/19, 14:33 - Sara: What do you mean?
7/27/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your singing improved a lot from what I've seen on youtube ❤ but I feel like you could practice it more, I don't really know much about singing so I don't really know
7/27/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: also probably being recorded on the phone is not the best, obviously
7/27/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😘
7/27/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I knew more about music but I don't so asking me about opinion or advice is not the best option 😢
7/27/19, 14:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 14:39 - Sara: Yeah, this was the first try haha
7/27/19, 14:39 - Sara: You can hear so it is okay
7/27/19, 14:39 - Sara: :p
7/27/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wonder how effective are singing lessons
7/27/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: you are already quite good so it could be nice
7/27/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: it probably wouldn't help me though 😂
7/27/19, 14:40 - Sara: I’m sure
7/27/19, 14:40 - Sara: Everybody can improve :)
7/27/19, 14:40 - Sara: I thought about that
7/27/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: better than awful is probably still horrible 😂
7/27/19, 14:41 - Sara: Noooo
7/27/19, 14:41 - Sara: But i prefer improve my drums skills
7/27/19, 14:41 - Sara: I can improve singing just in a group
7/27/19, 14:41 - Sara: That’s how i learnt ;p
7/27/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: there is also always youtube 😋
7/27/19, 14:43 - Sara: As well
7/27/19, 14:43 - Sara: Do you think i need them?
7/27/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably wouldn't hurt, singing is not really an easy thing
7/27/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: lessons are sort of like taking a raw diamond
7/27/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: and shaping it to make it better
7/27/19, 14:45 - Sara: I’ll see
7/27/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's already a diamond from the start
7/27/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it can be improved
7/27/19, 14:45 - Sara: Depending on my future in music
7/27/19, 14:45 - Sara: :)
7/27/19, 14:46 - Sara: Thanks
7/27/19, 14:46 - Sara: I’ll see
7/27/19, 14:46 - Sara: We are going back home
7/27/19, 14:46 - Sara: Talk to ypu later
7/27/19, 14:47 - Sara: I hope you enjoy what i recorded you 💋
7/27/19, 14:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I genuinely liked what you sent me, but I'm a bit curious how professional training could improve it 💋
7/27/19, 14:47 - Sara: You can listen arthropoda haha
7/27/19, 14:47 - Sara: I had drum classes so hehe
7/27/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're doing what you love, that's all that matters
7/27/19, 14:48 - Sara: My last recording is insane

7/27/19, 15:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure babe ❤
7/27/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just checked and I have 7kg of different papers that I would like to take with me
7/27/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: quite a lot 🤔
7/27/19, 15:33 - Sara: 7kg? Why that amount?
7/27/19, 15:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, just a lot of stuff, syllabuses for my courses, notes etc.
7/27/19, 15:49 - Sara: Don’t you want to throw it away?
7/27/19, 15:49 - Sara: In my case, 95% of them are in my laptop
7/27/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll think about it, for now I just checked how much is it
7/27/19, 16:42 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/27/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: sleep tight love ❤

7/28/19, 05:48 - Sara: I went to the
7/28/19, 05:49 - Sara: Kitchen to talk with him. I told him i was bad and explain more or less the situacion but his girlfriend interrupted and i left the kitchen suddenly
7/28/19, 05:50 - Sara: He ignored me because “he did not want to interrupt me” mainly
7/28/19, 05:50 - Sara: I told him also to talk in private, but he rejected to talk now
7/28/19, 05:52 - Sara: He left without saying goodbye and then he wrote me what was happening, that i was driving him crazy and he had also more problems
7/28/19, 05:53 - Sara: And i’m writing a brief summary about what i told you
7/28/19, 05:55 - Sara: So yes... now i’m getting tired, but i’ll try to talk with people

7/28/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everything is fine, sleep well ❤️
7/28/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, the weather still seems pretty bad, but it's the last day of the festival so probably
7/28/19, 10:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can talk about it when you wake up cariño, I hope everything is more or less fine 🌹🌹🌹
7/28/19, 12:10 - Sara: ♥
7/28/19, 12:11 - Sara: Oh, so we cannot talk at night :(
7/28/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not completely sure, but I'm afraid so 😢

7/28/19, 12:14 - Sara: Maybe i have been harsh with him, idk
7/28/19, 12:15 - Sara: But at the same time he said like “you are drving me crazy, i have enough problems now” so xd
7/28/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like we've been through this exact same thing before
7/28/19, 12:15 - Sara: I know
7/28/19, 12:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: first you were sure that you're done with him, than he told you a few things and you have doubts
7/28/19, 12:17 - Sara: He did not tell me anything
7/28/19, 12:17 - Sara: But i was about to explode, you saw

7/28/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: yesterday? I was just reading a book, I didn't really feel like anything else
7/28/19, 12:19 - Sara: Why?
7/28/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I don't consider it a wasted time because I really like reading
7/28/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: and for a long time I stopped doing it so it's nice to do it again
7/28/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure, I was feeling kind of tired most of the day
7/28/19, 12:21 - Sara: Of course not ♥
7/28/19, 12:21 - Sara: Reading is a profit of knowledge
7/28/19, 12:21 - Sara: Not sleeping properly?
7/28/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: perhaps, I'm actually sleeping better now but that day I returned pretty late so probably that
7/28/19, 12:23 - Sara: Yes, and partying is not bad :3
7/28/19, 12:24 - Sara: And what about today?
7/28/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: for now, I don't know

7/28/19, 15:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, understandable, you were together a long time and you still care, nothing to be ashamed of
7/28/19, 15:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry that you have to go through this, but I'm sure you are strong enough to find a way ❤

7/28/19, 15:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/28/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like you already told him, although you don't seem completely convinced of that yet, it's probably best if you limit your contact and not know about each other
7/28/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: At this point it just seems to only hurt you
7/28/19, 15:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
7/28/19, 15:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully in time the feelings will fade, I'm not sure how to help you with that 🌹

7/29/19, 20:12 - Sara: I’m the subway, i’m tired
7/29/19, 20:12 - Sara: You? How was it?
7/29/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: office is closed so I didn't accomplish anything
7/29/19, 20:13 - Sara: Really? Why?
7/29/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: vacations I guess
7/29/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe next week
7/29/19, 20:13 - Sara: They don’t any poster with the info?
7/29/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: there is a paper on the door with days when the office was open but the dates on it are only until the 2nd of july
7/29/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: and it said closed until then
7/29/19, 20:15 - Sara: Write an email
7/29/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm also waiting for my promoter to send them my marks, it will be easier to convince them if they already have them before I contact them
7/29/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: he promised to do it this week
7/29/19, 20:17 - Sara: Nice nice
7/29/19, 20:18 - Sara: Cross 🤞
7/29/19, 20:18 - Sara: And what are you doing now?
7/29/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: preparing something to eat
7/29/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm going out soon so it's about time for dinner
7/29/19, 20:19 - Sara: What plan do you have for today?
7/29/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know exactly, we will probably just go to the center and have a beer or something
7/29/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vasiliki is leaving tomorrow
7/29/19, 20:20 - Sara: So nice!
7/29/19, 20:20 - Sara: Have fun and drink a lot of beer 😚
7/29/19, 20:20 - Sara: I won’t go out probably
7/29/19, 20:20 - Sara: I need to rest, i’m sooo tired xd
7/29/19, 20:21 - Sara: But if there is any plan, i’m the first to join haja
7/29/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: makes sense 😊
7/29/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: you can rest in the grave, now party 🥳😆
7/29/19, 20:22 - Sara: Yes, that is my phrase
7/29/19, 20:22 - Sara: “I prefer sleeping when i die” xD
7/29/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: better to just masturbate, why even bother sleeping 💜
7/29/19, 20:24 - Sara: Buah
7/29/19, 20:24 - Sara: I have just seen some instagram post about sex toys and i get lazy
7/29/19, 20:24 - Sara: Maybe i dislike now sex
7/29/19, 20:24 - Sara: HAHHAHAHAH nah
7/29/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would never believe that statement, no matter what 🐷
7/29/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌝
7/29/19, 20:26 - Sara: 🐷 hahahaha
7/29/19, 20:26 - Sara: 🌚
7/29/19, 20:26 - Sara: Don’t believe it
7/29/19, 20:26 - Sara: Maybe in a couple of days i’ll be horny af again
7/29/19, 20:26 - Sara: Not more than you yesterday 🌝 🌝 🌝
7/29/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: excuse me, you did it 4 times, I only 3 💜
7/29/19, 20:27 - Sara: But it was so bad that i could not hear your dirty words 😥😓😭
7/29/19, 20:27 - Sara: Well, that boner shows the opposite 😁
7/29/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
7/29/19, 20:29 - Sara: 🤓
7/29/19, 20:29 - Sara: Ups 🙊
7/29/19, 20:29 - Sara: So next time a microphone
7/29/19, 20:30 - Sara: Maybe that was failed in my case
7/29/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll figure something out
7/29/19, 20:31 - Sara: Buah, online sex is difficult
7/29/19, 20:31 - Sara: In my case also was hard showing you and see the screen at the same time 😂
7/29/19, 20:31 - Sara: But it was 💜
7/29/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me too, I guess a small internet camera would be nice
7/29/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because using the laptop one is difficult
7/29/19, 20:33 - Sara: What is the difference?
7/29/19, 20:33 - Sara: Damn, like in the 2000s
7/29/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can set that camera somewhere so that it shows everything and you don't have to move your screen in weird positions
7/29/19, 20:37 - Sara: Well, true
7/29/19, 20:38 - Sara: Well, it is about improving with practice :)
7/29/19, 20:53 - Sara: Probably you’ll kill me, but my ex wrote me about the party and everything behind
7/29/19, 20:53 - Sara: I’m thinking about talking both of us in depth about everything
7/29/19, 20:53 - Sara: To clarify
7/29/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you trust what he tells you, do it
7/29/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is difficult for me to judge this situation, but talking about problems and issues can only help, I think
7/29/19, 20:55 - Sara: I hope
7/29/19, 20:55 - Sara: He told me his girlfriend also compares herself with me
7/29/19, 20:55 - Sara: That is shocking
7/29/19, 20:56 - Sara: This is weird for the three of us
7/29/19, 20:57 - Sara: I hope everything goes fine
7/29/19, 20:58 - Sara: Hating, avoiding people is not something i want in my life
7/29/19, 20:58 - Sara: That feeling is toxic for me
7/29/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: not really, considering her reactions before I don't think she feels very safe at the moment
7/29/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't think it should be a part of it
7/29/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: which is why I think you should talk
7/29/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: but have in mind what's best for you
7/29/19, 21:00 - Sara: Which reactions?
7/29/19, 21:00 - Sara: Of course
7/29/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: when she blocked him everywhere?
7/29/19, 21:00 - Sara: Oh true
7/29/19, 21:00 - Sara: She was preparing herself for the party
7/29/19, 21:00 - Sara: Why should i evoke fear to people? It is not fair
7/29/19, 21:01 - Sara: Not fair for her, not me suffering this and for him being in between of everything
7/29/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I guess neither of you seemed very sure what the relation between you will be going forward
7/29/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: people fear uncertainty
7/29/19, 21:03 - Sara: Between him and me?
7/29/19, 21:03 - Sara: That is unavoidable
7/29/19, 21:03 - Sara: But why this
7/29/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I had an answer to that 😒
7/29/19, 21:05 - Sara: Yes...
7/29/19, 21:05 - Sara: Just wish me luck
7/29/19, 21:05 - Sara: I hope fix this
7/29/19, 21:05 - Sara: Thanks for the support bebé 💕
7/29/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buena suerte, amor ❤
7/29/19, 21:06 - Sara: Gracias 😊

7/29/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure
7/29/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: be honest and think about yourself
7/29/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤
7/29/19, 21:09 - Sara: Thanks :)
7/29/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
7/29/19, 22:41 - Sara: At the moment nice

7/29/19, 22:43 - Sara: Private?
7/29/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
7/29/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, not university owned
7/29/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vasiliki leaves there
7/29/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: And they are much nicer than university ones
7/29/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: And a little bit cheaper even
7/29/19, 22:44 - Sara: Really?

8/1/19, 16:25 - Sara: Finally? Haha
8/1/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably, same happened with mine
8/1/19, 16:26 - Sara: Really? That is shif
8/1/19, 16:26 - Sara: Shit
8/1/19, 16:26 - Sara: Planning studying?
8/1/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably a bit before going to meet the others
8/1/19, 16:27 - Sara: Polish history?
8/1/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, probably for the exam
8/1/19, 16:27 - Sara: When did you start?
8/1/19, 16:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Today 😬
8/1/19, 16:28 - Sara: Nice! Good luck 😘
8/1/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: What plans do you have?
8/1/19, 16:30 - Sara: I had the plans with my ex but he has lost the bus for going to Toledo, so we don’t know
8/1/19, 16:31 - Sara: At the moment i would like to exercise a bit, have a shower, study a bit and watch the documentary minimum
8/1/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sounds good, great that you stick to the habits 👌❤️❤️❤️
8/1/19, 16:32 - Sara: Maybe i can go on my own and record something
8/1/19, 16:33 - Sara: Yes ♥ i’m happy for that
8/1/19, 16:34 - Sara: But sad for not having plans at night
8/1/19, 16:35 - Sara: I feel a noob when everybody goes out and not me 😂
8/1/19, 16:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, technically you had, they just didn't work out
8/1/19, 16:39 - Sara: True 😭
8/1/19, 16:39 - Sara: Well, tomorrow i’ll have plans with Christian so i’m happy
8/1/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: besides, why so fixated on going out, if you stay at home and enjoy it, what's wrong with that?
8/1/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: nice 😊
8/1/19, 16:41 - Sara: I’m a non-house person
8/1/19, 16:41 - Sara: I feel that i lose my time being at home
8/1/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: fair enough, for me if I stay and for example read a book I really like, I'm still happy but I guess that's just me
8/1/19, 16:42 - Sara: Lazy boi 💋
8/1/19, 16:42 - Sara: I feel i have wasted a month, idk
8/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: And, despite the fact it is fine to have time for myself (the first time in my life) i’m afraid of feeling alone
8/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: Or afraid of not spending the enough time with my friends and them getting further from me
8/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: Idk i’m weird
8/1/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it is something new to you, I guess it's normal that it feels weird and will probably take some time to get used to, don't worry 💋
8/1/19, 16:46 - Sara: Get used to what? Feeling alone? 🙃
8/1/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: taking time for yourself
8/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: True
8/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: But idk
8/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: I have this constant pressure of meeting in order not to lose friends
8/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: Idk right now
8/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: I’m overthinking
8/1/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: is it a pressure from them or just something that you think?
8/1/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You haven't been there for almost one year and you didn't them...
8/1/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: didn't lose them*
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: I doubt
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: People have changed i think
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: But yes, some has stayed
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: Real ones?
8/1/19, 16:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would say so
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: I have to see
8/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: If you’re busy, tell me
8/1/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's fine
8/1/19, 16:50 - Sara: Sure?

8/1/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: seems nice but I haven't seen them on you (besides the chinese dress) so hard to tell ❤

8/1/19, 17:33 - Sara: I feel alone idk why
8/1/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: tell me
8/1/19, 17:34 - Sara: I think i should do my stuff and forget it
8/1/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any idea why you might be feeling that way?
8/1/19, 17:36 - Sara: Maybe for not having plans, afraid of feeling bored or alone
8/1/19, 17:37 - Sara: I’ll try to avoid that
8/1/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you don't have plans with others you maybe you can try to make your own plans, for your own time
8/1/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it can be helpful
8/1/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said you like having Sara time so try to make the most out of it
8/1/19, 17:39 - Sara: I’ll try
8/1/19, 17:39 - Sara: Thanks
8/1/19, 17:39 - Sara: I have to learn that you are not going to be there always haha
8/1/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think I will be staying out long tonight
8/1/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Guys have to wake up early so probably not staying long
8/1/19, 17:40 - Sara: You should! These are the last dayss
8/1/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But they have to take bus to the airport very early so not really possible
8/1/19, 17:42 - Sara: At what time?
8/1/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: 6 or 7 so Nicco told me that he will stay probably until midnight at most

8/2/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, first I met with Eva
8/2/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: We met in Barazza, there were some of her Belgian friends and also two Australians
8/2/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really loved their accent
8/2/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: So cool, native English speakers sound great
8/2/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then we went to her faculty because she needed to pick up some of her stuff
8/2/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later we were playing pool, we went back to the dorms
8/2/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Every time I mentioned you she was like awwww so cute 😍
8/2/19, 01:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later I met Nicco, we talked about some random stuff, later we played a lot of pool
8/2/19, 01:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: And in the end we had to say goodbye 😢
8/2/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I actually got a bit closer to him in these last few weeks, I'm happy about that
8/2/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: So now it's over, I'm the last man standing from the fucking squaf
8/2/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Squad*
8/2/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😭
8/2/19, 01:45 - Sara: That is okay
8/2/19, 01:46 - Sara: 👍
8/2/19, 01:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/2/19, 01:46 - Sara: Stolen?

8/2/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a final trophy for finishing Erasmus 😊
8/2/19, 01:48 - Sara: A nice one 👌🏻
8/2/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
8/2/19, 01:48 - Sara: Better
8/2/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You sure? 💋💋💋
8/2/19, 01:49 - Sara: I mean
8/2/19, 01:49 - Sara: I had a breakdown because these days i felt lack of your love and support and i fucking miss you, so i feel alone and i’m always thinking how fine it would be being next to you
8/2/19, 01:49 - Sara: However, i told you i was bad and you didn’t care
8/2/19, 01:50 - Sara: I understand it, it is the last night with nicco
8/2/19, 01:50 - Sara: Also that i don’t like talking with drunk people
8/2/19, 01:50 - Sara: I cried, i played music, and i’m talking with Guada
8/2/19, 01:50 - Sara: Nothing important
8/2/19, 01:50 - Sara: I’ll go to sleep soon
8/2/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, it's difficult to manage, I had to say goodbye to many people these last few days and I'm rather sad too
8/2/19, 01:52 - Sara: Nah, it is okay
8/2/19, 01:52 - Sara: Your life is there
8/2/19, 01:52 - Sara: I can keep distance
8/2/19, 01:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry if I wasn't there for you 😔
8/2/19, 01:53 - Sara: It hurts but i understand it
8/2/19, 01:53 - Sara: You are happy and tipsy, that what matters
8/2/19, 01:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You go out a lot and I cannot talk to you a lot too, it's hard but it's fine, after all we didn't want to be the couple that's only focused on each other all the time, right?
8/2/19, 01:55 - Sara: True
8/2/19, 01:55 - Sara: Well
8/2/19, 01:55 - Sara: I exaggerate
8/2/19, 01:55 - Sara: Thanks
8/2/19, 01:55 - Sara: I should sleep
8/2/19, 01:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry but it feels a bit like it's ok for you to go out but not for me sometimes
8/2/19, 01:56 - Sara: Yes
8/2/19, 01:56 - Sara: That is the reason i keep distance
8/2/19, 01:57 - Sara: Good night
8/2/19, 01:57 - Sara: I will think
8/2/19, 01:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want you to be close and feel my support but please don't make me feel guilty everytime I cannot answer you immediately
8/2/19, 01:58 - Sara: Ok
8/2/19, 01:59 - Sara: It is not about you feeling guilty
8/2/19, 01:59 - Sara: But if that what i made you feel, sorry
8/2/19, 01:59 - Sara: Do not say then you can help me when you cannot
8/2/19, 02:00 - Sara: I knew it
8/2/19, 02:01 - Sara: Again, i apologize
8/2/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know I cannot do that sometimes, but I want to at least try, or at least let you know that I'm here for you
8/2/19, 02:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, I'm not angry, I love you and I want to be there for you ❤️
8/2/19, 02:01 - Sara: In my case i feel bad when i’m ignored, but at least i know now what to do
8/2/19, 02:02 - Sara: I will try not to annoy you
8/2/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't ignore you, I just sometimes cannot answer, you do the same when you go out and it's fine, you just answer when you have a moment
8/2/19, 02:03 - Sara: Okay
8/2/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't annoy me, really
8/2/19, 02:03 - Sara: Do not worry
8/2/19, 02:03 - Sara: Good night
8/2/19, 02:04 - Sara: I’m glad you has fun, really
8/2/19, 02:04 - Sara: Had*
8/2/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, sorry that I wasn't there when you needed me
8/2/19, 02:05 - Sara: It is okay
8/2/19, 02:05 - Sara: I understand if
8/2/19, 02:05 - Sara: It*
8/2/19, 02:05 - Sara: It is normal
8/2/19, 02:06 - Sara: I was a fool when i thought the opposite 😂
8/2/19, 02:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, you weren't, I want you to feel happy, but I have my life, as you have yours and we should let each other have that
8/2/19, 02:09 - Sara: Okay
8/2/19, 02:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still, text me whenever you need, I'll answer whenever I can
8/2/19, 02:10 - Sara: Okay
8/2/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really wish I could go and hug you now
8/2/19, 02:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope I can do that as soon as possible
8/2/19, 02:10 - Sara: I need to sleep
8/2/19, 02:11 - Sara: Good night
8/2/19, 02:11 - Sara: Have a nice day tomorrow
8/2/19, 02:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: You too, we should talk tomorrow
8/2/19, 02:15 - Sara: If you don’t want to know about me when you are out don’t ask
8/2/19, 02:16 - Sara: If you see me sad, show me support, don’t only disconnects
8/2/19, 02:16 - Sara: If you see that i’m sad, don’t ask me to sing because i’m crying
8/2/19, 02:17 - Sara: If i say i miss you, don’t treat me like a paranoid
8/2/19, 02:17 - Sara: Don’t tell me A when it is B
8/2/19, 02:17 - Sara: Relationships are about caring
8/2/19, 02:18 - Sara: And yes, i waited to tell you why i was sad/bad
8/2/19, 02:18 - Sara: I feel that you care sometimes
8/2/19, 02:19 - Sara: I should sleep, because i’m kind of angry but i need to speak up my mind
8/2/19, 02:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, and this is one of the saddest night I had here, I am alone now and depressed and it's not like you cared a lot
8/2/19, 02:19 - Sara: Why?
8/2/19, 02:19 - Sara: Why sad? You said it was fine
8/2/19, 02:20 - Sara: Tell me more
8/2/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I see that you have your problems, I don't want to burden you with mine
8/2/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that it hurts you to see me bad
8/2/19, 02:20 - Sara: Your problems are mine
8/2/19, 02:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you already have enough to worry about
8/2/19, 02:20 - Sara: No
8/2/19, 02:20 - Sara: It hurst more if i don’t know you are bad
8/2/19, 02:21 - Sara: Dime más
8/2/19, 02:21 - Sara: I want to fix ir
8/2/19, 02:21 - Sara: It*
8/2/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm just the last one, nothing is left, it's a definite end and I don't know what to do with myself
8/2/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I miss you so much
8/2/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I feel like I cannot help you
8/2/19, 02:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just so useless
8/2/19, 02:22 - Sara: Don’t worry about me now
8/2/19, 02:22 - Sara: Focus on you
8/2/19, 02:22 - Sara: You have your life
8/2/19, 02:23 - Sara: Ainara is still there :)
8/2/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you are a part of it
8/2/19, 02:23 - Sara: Just look forward and be positive
8/2/19, 02:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, she didn't give a fuck today and it's not like we are close or something
8/2/19, 02:23 - Sara: I understand that it is though to see all people go
8/2/19, 02:24 - Sara: But don’t think erasmus us ending of the story
8/2/19, 02:24 - Sara: But there will be more
8/2/19, 02:25 - Sara: That erasmus can influence a lot in your future, in your decisions and in your perception about yourself
8/2/19, 02:25 - Sara: Didn’t give a fuck?
8/2/19, 02:25 - Sara: This time can be as a reflective week
8/2/19, 02:26 - Sara: That you can decide about what to do
8/2/19, 02:26 - Sara: Revisiting places
8/2/19, 02:26 - Sara: Even thinking about the past events that made you feel happy
8/2/19, 02:26 - Sara: I feel right now
8/2/19, 02:27 - Sara: The same
8/2/19, 02:27 - Sara: Literally
8/2/19, 02:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just feel alone again, you are out all the time, and that is fine but we talk very little lately
8/2/19, 02:27 - Sara: Even worse, because i was selfish and i could not read between lines
8/2/19, 02:27 - Sara: Both of us are out
8/2/19, 02:28 - Sara: Yesterday i wanted to talk moRe, but i know you are busy studying or reading
8/2/19, 02:28 - Sara: And that is your life, i do not want to interrupt
8/2/19, 02:28 - Sara: Just tell me and i’ll be there
8/2/19, 02:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm doing that because I have nothing to do with my life, I'm happy to stop and talk with you
8/2/19, 02:29 - Sara: It is hard for me to say that i’m available, even sad because i think you are busy with more important things to do
8/2/19, 02:29 - Sara: You have a lot of things with your life! Why do you think the opposite?
8/2/19, 02:29 - Sara: How are you feeling?
8/2/19, 02:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much better, I probably need some sleep, I'm a bit drunk too so it not exactly helpful
8/2/19, 02:31 - Sara: Up to you
8/2/19, 02:31 - Sara: I don’t want to annoy
8/2/19, 02:31 - Sara: I’m really sorry
8/2/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: What about you, why do you feel lonely?
8/2/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: What can I do?
8/2/19, 02:32 - Sara: Don’t worry
8/2/19, 02:32 - Sara: Focus on you
8/2/19, 02:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, it's never annoying, I'm serious
8/2/19, 02:32 - Sara: Really ♥
8/2/19, 02:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I want to help you too, however I can
8/2/19, 02:32 - Sara: Sometimes you need your sosve, that is reasone okay
8/2/19, 02:33 - Sara: Help yourself first
8/2/19, 02:33 - Sara: Please
8/2/19, 02:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll be better once I go back to Poland
8/2/19, 02:34 - Sara: Why?
8/2/19, 02:34 - Sara: You have always said you do not want to go back
8/2/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm just sad and nostalgic, maybe if I go there and start figuring out something more permanent it will be better
8/2/19, 02:35 - Sara: Cannot do it now?
8/2/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Permanent, meaning like 1-2 years at most I hope
8/2/19, 02:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, I have one week left here, what can I do
8/2/19, 02:36 - Sara: What you want in the future
8/2/19, 02:36 - Sara: Have a list
8/2/19, 02:36 - Sara: Specify how to get these goals
8/2/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a general idea, but that's about it, I cannot do anything more until I'm there
8/2/19, 02:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's hard to see myself there now too, after such a long time abroad
8/2/19, 02:38 - Sara: More motivation to decide to move out
8/2/19, 02:38 - Sara: Do not be neGative
8/2/19, 02:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I cannot do that anytime soon
8/2/19, 02:38 - Sara: I’m sure there are also things in Poland that make you feel better
8/2/19, 02:39 - Sara: Establish small goals
8/2/19, 02:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that 😂
8/2/19, 02:40 - Sara: Apply it :p
8/2/19, 02:41 - Sara: How can i help you?
8/2/19, 02:42 - Sara: If i record it tomorrow are you going to be happier? ❤
8/2/19, 02:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's fine, you don't have to
8/2/19, 02:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I'll just go to sleep, maybe tomorrow it will be better
8/2/19, 02:43 - Sara: I know that i don’t have to
8/2/19, 02:43 - Sara: But i want to
8/2/19, 02:43 - Sara: I’m really sorry Kamil 😣
8/2/19, 02:44 - Sara: Okay
8/2/19, 02:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry about it, you're amazing and I love you, don't forget that
8/2/19, 02:45 - Sara: I have failed you 😭😭😭😭😭😭
8/2/19, 02:45 - Sara: Text me, call me, send smoke signs or a telegram if you need something
8/2/19, 02:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I failed you, we can learn from that and be better
8/2/19, 02:45 - Sara: I hope
8/2/19, 02:45 - Sara: But i don’t deserve that
8/2/19, 02:46 - Sara: Do you need anything else?
8/2/19, 02:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just sleep at the moment, also a way to help you but I don't know how
8/2/19, 02:47 - Sara: I can do it on my own
8/2/19, 02:48 - Sara: Probably it was a childish situation
8/2/19, 02:48 - Sara: Go to sleep, amor
8/2/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You too, cariño
8/2/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: We should talk tomorrow
8/2/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: Okay
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: Sorry for everything
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: I feel ashamed
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: Sleep tight
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: Keep it in mind please
8/2/19, 02:49 - Sara: Always count on me

8/2/19, 19:25 - Sara: Thanks ♥
8/2/19, 19:25 - Sara: Btw: the erotic shop was closed and we are #crying
8/2/19, 19:25 - Sara: Id know if i should improve them
8/2/19, 19:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like how?
8/2/19, 19:26 - Sara: Brush them? Haha also make them darker? Idk
8/2/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue 😂
8/2/19, 19:26 - Sara: People work on their eyebrows and for me it is weird
8/2/19, 19:26 - Sara: Beauty imposition i suppose
8/2/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I sometimes pluck them a little bit between them
8/2/19, 19:27 - Sara: Oh, didn’t know the verb :p
8/2/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unibrow is not something I want 😂
8/2/19, 19:27 - Sara: I thought about that for havig a better shape but... i like my forest
8/2/19, 19:27 - Sara: Why no? :(
8/2/19, 19:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/2/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it suits me very well, I'm not Frida
8/2/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😋
8/2/19, 19:28 - Sara: Frida is perfect ♥
8/2/19, 19:28 - Sara: You will be cute with or without ♥
8/2/19, 19:29 - Sara: One of my fav drummer has it hahaha ~fucking ukranians~
8/2/19, 19:29 - Sara: XD
8/2/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so I'll just shave them off completely
8/2/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think if I didn't do that I still wouldn't have a unibrow because it doesn't grow that much but I pay attention to the details
8/2/19, 19:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/2/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I get rid off it anyway
8/2/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perfection ❤️
8/2/19, 19:30 - Sara: Details?
8/2/19, 19:30 - Sara: Lady gaga does not have them neither and she is a queen
8/2/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/2/19, 19:32 - Sara: Mmmm
8/2/19, 19:32 - Sara: True
8/2/19, 19:32 - Sara: But sometimes she hides them
8/2/19, 19:32 - Sara: And paint other ones
8/2/19, 19:32 - Sara: Drag queen do that :p
8/2/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't like that, I like natural eyebrows
8/2/19, 19:33 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/2/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe with a little bit of care
8/2/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: But nothing drastic
8/2/19, 19:33 - Sara: People can do whatever they want
8/2/19, 19:33 - Sara: I will like people however :p
8/2/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I'm not telling anyone what to do
8/2/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I can just like certain something a bit more
8/2/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't mean that it's very important
8/2/19, 19:34 - Sara: Of course
8/2/19, 19:34 - Sara: ♥

8/3/19, 04:47 - Sara: It did not work that good xd
8/3/19, 04:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm assuming you're not going to masturbate with a cat so it should be easier to hide
8/3/19, 04:48 - Sara: Imagine

8/3/19, 04:48 - Sara: Yep trye

8/3/19, 12:45 - Sara: Calling will be more difficult
8/3/19, 12:46 - Sara: Literally idk what we are going to do
8/3/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whatever you need, I'm available ❤️
8/3/19, 12:47 - Sara: What are you doing, polish explorer?
8/3/19, 12:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Getting up from my bed, slowly 😂
8/3/19, 12:47 - Sara: Niiice
8/3/19, 12:47 - Sara: Any plans?
8/3/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
8/3/19, 12:48 - Sara: Not reading, studying?
8/3/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably yes
8/3/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's not much of a plan
8/3/19, 12:50 - Sara: It is somethinf
8/3/19, 12:51 - Sara: My sister and i are going to play monopoly with my cousin  x
8/3/19, 12:51 - Sara: Is everything okay?
8/3/19, 12:51 - Sara: I can answer from time to time
8/3/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Be careful, at the end you may hate each other ❤️
8/3/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Intense game 😂
8/3/19, 12:52 - Sara: Fuck capitalism x)

8/3/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have to be ruthless
8/3/19, 12:53 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I love monopoly, you get rich and you travel a lot
8/3/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Basically all I want from life 😂
8/3/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 14:35 - Sara: Me as fbi ♥
8/3/19, 14:35 - Sara: Am i a plant now? 🌱
8/3/19, 14:36 - Sara: Now i’m an adult now because i like playing hah
8/3/19, 14:36 - Sara: How is it going?
8/3/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: fine, slowly starting the day
8/3/19, 14:37 - Sara: You still in bed?
8/3/19, 14:39 - Sara: https://twitter.com/assadarino/status/1157400030791311361?s=21 i wish the two of us like this ♥
8/3/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: No but I haven't done anything productive yet
8/3/19, 14:40 - Sara: So what did yo do?
8/3/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I exercised a bit, ate my breakfast, in the meantime watched some stuff on youtube, nothing interesting, low on motivation
8/3/19, 14:42 - Sara: Low on motivation? Why?
8/3/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot solve my problems, just have to wait, so feeling mostly stressed and useless
8/3/19, 14:49 - Sara: Do you want to call each other later?
8/3/19, 14:49 - Sara: Do not say that
8/3/19, 14:49 - Sara: You are not that
8/3/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry, if you have some time sure, but focus on your family
8/3/19, 15:05 - Sara: I can always text
8/3/19, 15:05 - Sara: I want you to be okay
8/3/19, 15:05 - Sara: That is a priority
8/3/19, 15:06 - Sara: You are a priority ♥
8/3/19, 15:07 - Sara: Tell me, what comes to your mind?
8/3/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing, I just have to wait, maybe next week I will know if I'm screwed or not
8/3/19, 15:09 - Sara: How can you screw it?
8/3/19, 15:09 - Sara: What happens if you screw it?
8/3/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: nah, it's about all the paperwork, if the office here doesn't agree to sign it (which they totally don't have to) I don't know what I'm going to do
8/3/19, 15:10 - Sara: They will sign it
8/3/19, 15:11 - Sara: What is the use of not making the situation more complex?
8/3/19, 15:11 - Sara: It is about validating your credits right?
8/3/19, 15:12 - Sara: Sometimes i get lost with all this situation 😭
8/3/19, 15:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: pretty much, it all starts and ends with the shitty thesis situation
8/3/19, 15:13 - Sara: They will do it
8/3/19, 15:13 - Sara: Trust yourself and the whole situation
8/3/19, 15:13 - Sara: Did they complain about all of this?
8/3/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: if the thesis went well I would just finish it, present it here and got the mark
8/3/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: but my belgian promoter made it difficult
8/3/19, 15:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: the initial idea was not exactly what I ended up doing and tbh it feels pretty useless
8/3/19, 15:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: not to mention that it's quite difficult to even contact him
8/3/19, 15:16 - Sara: I’m sure everything will have a solution
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: Really, i hope these people not to be such assholes
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: Missed voice call
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: I call you later!
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: But yes, you cannot do anything unfortunatelly
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: But you should not feel bad
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: You have done your best
8/3/19, 15:17 - Sara: And your thesis will be great
8/3/19, 15:18 - Sara: You have worked hard throughout the year
8/3/19, 15:20 - Sara: Even if the thesis at the beginning seemed senseless, it will end completely different
8/3/19, 15:22 - Sara: You’ll go through it perfectly... because you are quite smart enough for this situation
8/3/19, 15:22 - Sara: But never lose hope or motivation
8/3/19, 15:23 - Sara: And if this happens, tell me and i’ll give you some
8/3/19, 15:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which one is you?
8/3/19, 15:49 - Sara: Is it not clear? :p
8/3/19, 15:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nobody looks depressed so I'm confused 💋
8/3/19, 15:49 - Sara: The baby looks more serious
8/3/19, 15:49 - Sara: So maybe that is me
8/3/19, 15:50 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 15:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, the baby looks like it knows what it's doing
8/3/19, 15:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: So probably not
8/3/19, 15:50 - Sara: 😂
8/3/19, 15:50 - Sara: A baby spy
8/3/19, 15:50 - Sara: Daaaaaaamn

8/3/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: not quite the satisfyer but it's something
8/3/19, 16:14 - Sara: What is it made of? :o
8/3/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: leather and velvet
8/3/19, 16:15 - Sara: Damn
8/3/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 16:15 - Sara: Idk how is having that in your vagina
8/3/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know either
8/3/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😆
8/3/19, 16:16 - Sara: Well, if it is nice...
8/3/19, 16:16 - Sara: Btw, we can do a test later
8/3/19, 16:16 - Sara: Or pictionary
8/3/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, if you have some time
8/3/19, 16:17 - Sara: I will have a lot :)
8/3/19, 18:03 - Sara: Calling you in a second :p
8/3/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 20:00 - Sara: Perfect 👏🏽
8/3/19, 20:00 - Sara: Did you enjoy it?
8/3/19, 20:00 - Sara: So fast
8/3/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: what happened?
8/3/19, 20:01 - Sara: Nothing
8/3/19, 20:01 - Sara: It just kind of not enjoying it
8/3/19, 20:01 - Sara: So i stopped
8/3/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any particular reason?
8/3/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Should we do something differently?
8/3/19, 20:02 - Sara: Why different?
8/3/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it's not enjoyable
8/3/19, 20:02 - Sara: It is okay
8/3/19, 20:02 - Sara: I’m not alone
8/3/19, 20:02 - Sara: So i get stressed
8/3/19, 20:02 - Sara: But if you enjoy it, i’m happy
8/3/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, sorry that I tried now, I should wait
8/3/19, 20:03 - Sara: 😊
8/3/19, 20:03 - Sara: Wait for what?
8/3/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: A better moment
8/3/19, 20:03 - Sara: It is okay if you can
8/3/19, 20:03 - Sara: It is partly my fault to think i can enjoy it
8/3/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anyway, I'm sorry, I didn't think this through
8/3/19, 20:04 - Sara: It is okay
8/3/19, 20:04 - Sara: You enjoyed, i’m happy for that
8/3/19, 20:04 - Sara: I don’t want to interrupt anything
8/3/19, 20:05 - Sara: Or to stop your masturbation because i cannot
8/3/19, 20:05 - Sara: I just felt a little bit useless for not being able to get it
8/3/19, 20:05 - Sara: For being hurt
8/3/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, if I was stressed I wouldn't be able too
8/3/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're not useless
8/3/19, 20:06 - Sara: 😔
8/3/19, 20:06 - Sara: I am
8/3/19, 20:06 - Sara: How was it possible? I cannot even make you more excited
8/3/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is only so much we can do over the phone
8/3/19, 20:07 - Sara: I know
8/3/19, 20:07 - Sara: But i could before
8/3/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: In person, it's a different story ❤️
8/3/19, 20:07 - Sara: Why is this happening again? ><
8/3/19, 20:07 - Sara: Of course
8/3/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: We had more privacy, don't worry
8/3/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again?
8/3/19, 20:07 - Sara: Not with you, don’t worry
8/3/19, 20:08 - Sara: But this is my life now
8/3/19, 20:08 - Sara: Well
8/3/19, 20:08 - Sara: Next time, don’t worry
8/3/19, 20:08 - Sara: You enjoyed it, so that is nice
8/3/19, 20:09 - Sara: I reached my goal 💪
8/3/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: So far, it's an experiment, we can learn
8/3/19, 20:09 - Sara: But it went good
8/3/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: But what do you mean with "this"?
8/3/19, 20:09 - Sara: Oh
8/3/19, 20:09 - Sara: Sexual frustration
8/3/19, 20:10 - Sara: But i don’t want to give it importance
8/3/19, 20:10 - Sara: Don’t worry
8/3/19, 20:10 - Sara: You should do your stuff
8/3/19, 20:10 - Sara: 😊
8/3/19, 20:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something tells me this is not your face right now
8/3/19, 20:11 - Sara: Neutral face
8/3/19, 20:11 - Sara: I’ll figure out how to avoid what happened today
8/3/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: More private setting, so that you can relax, I think
8/3/19, 20:12 - Sara: Yes idk
8/3/19, 20:12 - Sara: Maybe it is my fault
8/3/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/3/19, 20:13 - Sara: Because if i don’t have a satisfyer i don’t get it
8/3/19, 20:13 - Sara: But again, it is not important
8/3/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Without the satisfyer it's more difficult and you couldn't relax and focus now so I think it's not your fault
8/3/19, 20:14 - Sara: I’ll figure out
8/3/19, 20:14 - Sara: If i cannot get an orgasm on my own when we are doing sexting it is a problem 🤷🏽‍♀
8/3/19, 20:15 - Sara: Because i don’t concentrate
8/3/19, 20:15 - Sara: I inevitably focus more on you
8/3/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is not weird, it's the same for me
8/3/19, 20:16 - Sara: But you get it
8/3/19, 20:16 - Sara: First time that you can do two tasks at the same time haha
8/3/19, 20:16 - Sara: I’ll see what to do
8/3/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It takes me a lot longer to reach it when we do the call
8/3/19, 20:16 - Sara: Sorry 😞
8/3/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sorry
8/3/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just different
8/3/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Closer to sex I guess
8/3/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because in sex I also focus more on you
8/3/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it takes me longer
8/3/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's actually very good
8/3/19, 20:17 - Sara: Why?
8/3/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: 47 seconds or 10 minutes?
8/3/19, 20:17 - Sara: True
8/3/19, 20:18 - Sara: But you should focus on yourself
8/3/19, 20:18 - Sara: Idk what to do
8/3/19, 20:18 - Sara: Maybe  next times i can help you but not doing anything
8/3/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, please, that's not the point of all of this
8/3/19, 20:19 - Sara: What is it?
8/3/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just wanted to do something that could make us feel closer physically
8/3/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's not working very well
8/3/19, 20:19 - Sara: And we can continue
8/3/19, 20:20 - Sara: It was only one day, do not worry
8/3/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: After all it's just a call
8/3/19, 20:20 - Sara: We shall continue
8/3/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, but you pick the moment
8/3/19, 20:20 - Sara: You tell me
8/3/19, 20:21 - Sara: I want you to enjoy it and have fun
8/3/19, 20:21 - Sara: And if i’m sad or i don’t get it, you won’t
8/3/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want the same for you
8/3/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: This was always my priority
8/3/19, 20:21 - Sara: I can enjoy without having an orgasm or sex
8/3/19, 20:21 - Sara: It shouldn’t
8/3/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want both of us to enjoy
8/3/19, 20:22 - Sara: I feel bad when people focus on me a lot
8/3/19, 20:22 - Sara: I enjoy when you enjoy
8/3/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same for me
8/3/19, 20:22 - Sara: And i won’t interrupt if you are honry and i’m not
8/3/19, 20:22 - Sara: And you were about to come
Now, so it was okay not to say i was bad or, in general, interrupting
8/3/19, 20:22 - Sara: It is obvious
8/3/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: In this case yes, but in general if you don't feel like we don't have to do anything
8/3/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm quite happy to just talk or play games
8/3/19, 20:23 - Sara: I won’t interrupt in any case
8/3/19, 20:24 - Sara: Even when i’m sad or whatever, i will try to help you
8/3/19, 20:25 - Sara: Because that what couples do: helping and wanting the best cor them
8/3/19, 20:26 - Sara: That i want empathy? Yes
8/3/19, 20:26 - Sara: Would i feel bad if i interrupt for that? As well
8/3/19, 20:27 - Sara: That also i love you and when you are honry, so handome, relax, happy? Yep
8/3/19, 20:27 - Sara: Sorry, Kamil. I will think more about you
8/3/19, 20:28 - Sara: And sorry for this
8/3/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I want to give that to you
8/3/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just don't know how to do it if I'm here or in Poland
8/3/19, 20:31 - Sara: You know ♥
8/3/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I love to see you horny and I want to help you enjoy that
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: And i love your support
8/3/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: and be happy, not frustrated
8/3/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: but it's difficult
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: Sex is not important to care about
8/3/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I'm still trying to figure it out
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: You don’t need to
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: It is okay
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: It is not your fault
8/3/19, 20:32 - Sara: Thanks anyway ♥
8/3/19, 20:34 - Sara: Really, kocham cię a lot
8/3/19, 20:34 - Sara: Thanks for caring
8/3/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: the least I can do
8/3/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Love you more ❤

8/3/19, 20:38 - Sara: Sorry if i need a lot of caring and attention
8/3/19, 20:38 - Sara: I want to give you space
8/3/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't be more distant, please
8/3/19, 20:40 - Sara: More? :/
8/3/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I mean distatnt in general
8/3/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you are distant now
8/3/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, kind of, Spain is pretty far 😋
8/3/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: unfortunately 😓
8/3/19, 20:42 - Sara: Okay
8/3/19, 20:43 - Sara: I’m feeling weird, can we talk later or tomorrow?
8/3/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you need some time, of course
8/3/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't hesitate to text me
8/3/19, 20:44 - Sara: I need you 💕
8/3/19, 20:44 - Sara: It is weird xd
8/3/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: why?
8/3/19, 20:45 - Sara: Because i need to feel closer to you
8/3/19, 20:45 - Sara: But also give you and me space
8/3/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: hmmm, I'll have to think about that, it's a pretty complex situation 😘
8/3/19, 20:47 - Sara: Okay
8/3/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry, we'll figure it out
8/3/19, 20:47 - Sara: I will exercise
8/3/19, 20:47 - Sara: It is my business, do not worry
8/3/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like this is more important than giving each other space
8/3/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least now
8/3/19, 20:48 - Sara: There must be a balance
8/3/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, but it's not going to be constant, I think
8/3/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: sometimes we might need to be closer together
8/3/19, 20:48 - Sara: Closer together?
8/3/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: sometimes we might need more space
8/3/19, 20:49 - Sara: Oh yes
8/3/19, 20:49 - Sara: True
8/3/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like now is probably not the time for more space, but maybe I'm wrong
8/3/19, 20:49 - Sara: Why?
8/3/19, 20:49 - Sara: Explain
8/3/19, 20:50 - Sara: I don’t want you to think that you are spending too much time on this
8/3/19, 20:50 - Sara: On me
8/3/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: this is a difficult time for both of us, I need you and you need me
8/3/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: we both have our problems
8/3/19, 20:51 - Sara: You need me more, probably
8/3/19, 20:51 - Sara: I should be more mature
8/3/19, 20:52 - Sara: I know that you always have me
8/3/19, 20:52 - Sara: You*
8/3/19, 20:52 - Sara: Arg i’m a disaster
8/3/19, 20:53 - Sara: I’m always trying not to worry about me or to leave me manage it on my own
8/3/19, 20:53 - Sara: I don’t want you to think that you have a pet rather than a couple
8/3/19, 20:53 - Sara: Trying people/you
8/3/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never considered it that way, I just want to help you when you need it
8/3/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: and I do hope that you would do the same for me
8/3/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you do actually
8/3/19, 20:55 - Sara: Of course, don’t doubt of that ♥
8/3/19, 20:55 - Sara: Thanks, really
8/3/19, 20:56 - Sara: If you get tired of me say it
8/3/19, 20:56 - Sara: Maybe today’s problem was a silly problem
8/3/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm getting tired of being far away
8/3/19, 20:56 - Sara: Why?
8/3/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: because I miss you 💋
8/3/19, 20:57 - Sara: I miss you too :,(
8/3/19, 20:57 - Sara: Soon we will be closer
8/3/19, 20:58 - Sara: Kamil, i’m starting to realise that i’m so afraid sometimes of you considering me not enough, or childish, and giving up
8/3/19, 20:58 - Sara: I don’t understand why 😞
8/3/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can only keep telling you that I don't think that way ❤
8/3/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's been already 33 days since you left 😢
8/3/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: so long 😓
8/3/19, 21:00 - Sara: Yes...
8/3/19, 21:00 - Sara: :(
8/3/19, 21:00 - Sara: But i hope see each other in september
8/3/19, 21:00 - Sara: Really?
8/3/19, 21:01 - Sara: People don’t like insecure, sad people
8/3/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: exactly, so why do you like me?
8/3/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Really, deal with it 😎
8/3/19, 21:02 - Sara: :P
8/3/19, 21:02 - Sara: You are different
8/3/19, 21:03 - Sara: I always think that people need to see me constantly perfect
8/3/19, 21:03 - Sara: Like pretty, always smart, good at sex
8/3/19, 21:03 - Sara: When i’m not, i just feel i’ll let people down
8/3/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: And do you see others that way? Constantly perfect?
8/3/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you feel let down when they are not?
8/3/19, 21:04 - Sara: Not at all
8/3/19, 21:04 - Sara: People are not always perfecf
8/3/19, 21:05 - Sara: I like when people are the way they are
8/3/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, believe me that people see you the same way, give them some credit
8/3/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: or at least I do
8/3/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I'm pretty sure that applies to majority
8/3/19, 21:06 - Sara: I don’t understand your point
8/3/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You demand much more from yourself than from others
8/3/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: people are not going to think any less of you if you are not always perfect
8/3/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/3/19, 21:07 - Sara: But me being perfect is not showing how shit i am normally
8/3/19, 21:07 - Sara: :p
8/3/19, 21:08 - Sara: I feel constant pressure
8/3/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: From yourself or from others?
8/3/19, 21:08 - Sara: From....
8/3/19, 21:08 - Sara: Probably myself
8/3/19, 21:09 - Sara: I don’t want people leave me alone
8/3/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: if anybody would do that because someone isn't constantly perfect than they would be huge assholes and definitely not worthy of you caring about them
8/3/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: you have some wonderful people around you
8/3/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: trust them
8/3/19, 21:20 - Sara: ♥

8/4/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Genial 💋

8/4/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Voy a hacer ejercicio un poco, desayunar y después leer y estudiar
8/4/19, 13:06 - Sara: Eso está muy bien 💋
8/4/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw I think you know more polish than you realize
8/4/19, 13:41 - Sara: Why?
8/4/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I found plenty of words that are either exactly the same or very similar in spanish and in polish
8/4/19, 13:42 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/4/19, 13:42 - Sara: Yep! I realize when we talk :p
8/4/19, 13:42 - Sara: Which ones?
8/4/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, please 🌝
8/4/19, 13:42 - Sara: Ñaaaam
8/4/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: literatura, profesor, fobia, moda, idiota, lista, bomba, temperatura, planeta, bestia, metro, bar, plan, oferta
8/4/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: these are exactly the same
8/4/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: there are many that are only slightly different
8/4/19, 13:44 - Sara: And do we pronounce it the same? Not, right?
8/4/19, 13:45 - Sara: That you write 2937844 accents on them
8/4/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: these I think yes
8/4/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have more that are almost the same but are pronounced differently
8/4/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: you have a ton of accents, in polish there are none
8/4/19, 13:46 - Sara: ???? XD
8/4/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: these are not accents
8/4/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: just completely different letters
8/4/19, 13:46 - Sara: Really? Damn
8/4/19, 13:46 - Sara: XD
8/4/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, in polish we don't write accents
8/4/19, 13:47 - Sara: In spanish sometimes
8/4/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you have time later we can compare some more words
8/4/19, 13:47 - Sara: But yep, why these similarities?
8/4/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: all the time...
8/4/19, 13:48 - Sara: Not really
8/4/19, 13:48 - Sara: There are certain rules
8/4/19, 13:48 - Sara: Words can have a specific stress but it is not always written with an accent
8/4/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, I guess there are some influences, from travel and what not, also from italian, french, english
8/4/19, 13:48 - Sara: True
8/4/19, 13:48 - Sara: So interesting 💕
8/4/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but they appear quite often 😆
8/4/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: so yeah, overall, you actually know some polish
8/4/19, 13:49 - Sara: Yayyyy
8/4/19, 13:50 - Sara: Finally i know Polish
8/4/19, 13:50 - Sara: 😂
8/4/19, 13:50 - Sara: Idk what is worse, writing it or pronounce it xD
8/4/19, 13:50 - Sara: More difficult i mean
8/4/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: existing in Poland 😢
8/4/19, 13:52 - Sara: Why?
8/4/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: polar bears
8/4/19, 13:52 - Sara: ? Hahaha
8/4/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: some time ago I read that some people (probably americans) think there are polar bears in Poland
8/4/19, 13:53 - Sara: Tell me that it is true xD

8/4/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: true, but also expensive 😢
8/4/19, 14:18 - Sara: How much?
8/4/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't checked all of them yet
8/4/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: the set of toys for both of us, probably around 200 euro
8/4/19, 14:19 - Sara: Uffffff
8/4/19, 14:19 - Sara: It is cheaper going to Berlin :p
8/4/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: we'll have to take a closer look
8/4/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: the one I sent you a picture yesterday was 70 euro, I think

8/4/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean the lovense one is of higher quality
8/4/19, 14:34 - Sara: I see :o
8/4/19, 14:34 - Sara: But more expensive 4 that
8/4/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 14 euro more is not that much
8/4/19, 14:35 - Sara: As well
8/4/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, there is a lot to take into account
8/4/19, 14:35 - Sara: For instance?
8/4/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: price, quality, it is something that you buy to use for a long time so quality is probably more important
8/4/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, I never bought a vibrator xd
8/4/19, 14:37 - Sara: I did it recently, so i'm not an expert :P
8/4/19, 14:37 - Sara: https://es.lovense.com/juguetes-sexuales-larga-distancia damn the video
8/4/19, 14:37 - Sara: Also if we can use it individually

8/4/19, 14:37 - Sara: Imagine
8/4/19, 14:37 - Sara: KAMIIIL, it's 4 am but wake up because i want to use it
8/4/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's possible with all of them
8/4/19, 14:38 - Sara: Well, you are a solete
8/4/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I saw that it's possible to program it to do certain vibrations so I can just wake up, turn it on, turn you on and go to sleep feeling happy 😋
8/4/19, 14:39 - Sara: That is brilliant
8/4/19, 14:39 - Sara: I'm loving it now xD
8/4/19, 14:40 - Sara: Damn

8/4/19, 14:42 - Sara: are you interested in all of these? Like sexual toys
8/4/19, 14:42 - Sara: Like because i like them and i'm curious does not mean that you are forced to like them or use them
8/4/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: for now, I'm interested in the ones for you, for myself, I'm not sure yet
8/4/19, 14:43 - Sara: why?
8/4/19, 14:43 - Sara: I have the satysfier
8/4/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I guess the main problem at the moment is money, also they are not very private, before I move out it's not the best idea, I'm afraid
8/4/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: but later, sure, why not ❤
8/4/19, 14:44 - Sara: Understandable
8/4/19, 14:44 - Sara: Move out to Poland right?

8/5/19, 12:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: The other picture I sent, just a small door
8/5/19, 12:39 - Sara: This is the real one i have in front of my building
8/5/19, 12:39 - Sara: Maybe the other one is in another place
8/5/19, 12:39 - Sara: But this is my house ♥
8/5/19, 12:39 - Sara: And this as well :)
8/5/19, 12:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, my friend from first semester in in Sevilla
8/5/19, 12:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is*
8/5/19, 12:40 - Sara: Which friend?
8/5/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Andrea Giuntini, I don't think you ever met
8/5/19, 12:42 - Sara: Tell him that he will die for melting
8/5/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/5/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: This one
8/5/19, 12:43 - Sara: You talked about him
8/5/19, 12:43 - Sara: Yep :)
8/5/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: He's Italian, he can probably handle it 😁
8/5/19, 12:44 - Sara: I’m sure
8/5/19, 12:44 - Sara: Sevilla is so great ♥
8/5/19, 12:44 - Sara: Well, Andalucia in general
8/5/19, 12:46 - Sara: But in summer... too hot xD
8/5/19, 12:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, isn't it your region? South? xd
8/5/19, 12:47 - Sara: Yes! ♥♥♥♥
8/5/19, 12:47 - Sara: And your region is you-Lost-the-poll
8/5/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was biased against me
8/5/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: We should ask Elía to do it
8/5/19, 12:48 - Sara: Try it, bitch
8/5/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Coward, you know you would lose
8/5/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Italians still remember all the lives you have taken
8/5/19, 12:50 - Sara: Lives? XD
8/5/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/5/19, 12:50 - Sara: Meh... Italians...
8/5/19, 12:51 - Sara: One more...one less...
8/5/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: One million, two million...
8/5/19, 12:51 - Sara: Not that important
8/5/19, 12:51 - Sara: How can i kill poles with pieroggis?
8/5/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You cannot, they are not the source of our power like pasta is for italians
8/5/19, 12:52 - Sara: Maybe saying that Poland is in the north pole haha
8/5/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will send my polar bear to pay you a visit and explain geography
8/5/19, 12:53 - Sara: 🐻
8/5/19, 12:53 - Sara: Oh, wait
8/5/19, 12:53 - Sara: That is you ♥

8/5/19, 12:54 - Sara: Geografia
8/5/19, 12:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>

8/5/19, 13:01 - Sara: Niiiice 😎

8/5/19, 13:01 - Sara: For you to learn
8/5/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you're not teaching me anything in spanish 😓
8/5/19, 13:02 - Sara: Do you want me to do it?
8/5/19, 13:02 - Sara: But you know a lot
8/5/19, 13:02 - Sara: Or do you struggle with something or interested in a specific topic?
8/5/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: just try to practice, I guess
8/5/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: listening also
8/5/19, 13:07 - Sara: Mmmmmm maybe you can start trying to speak
8/5/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about just texting on whatsapp, to use what I learned
8/5/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: that way I won't forget and it will be easier to start speaking, I guess
8/5/19, 13:09 - Sara: Maybe you learn more routinary language
8/5/19, 13:09 - Sara: Okay :) you tell me when
8/5/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: when you went to the city office with your card, what did you bring?
8/5/19, 13:21 - Sara: Oh i thought i told you
8/5/19, 13:21 - Sara: I don’t remember well
8/5/19, 13:21 - Sara: I think i needed only the card and a id photo
8/5/19, 13:21 - Sara: Because i remember printing a doxument they did not use
8/5/19, 13:26 - Sara: Are you going now?
8/5/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, I'll go soon
8/5/19, 13:27 - Sara: That is nice :)
8/5/19, 13:27 - Sara: Btw, thanks for the advice of doing exercise
8/5/19, 13:27 - Sara: A lot of people are seeing changes
8/5/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: you started it yourself, I just encouraged you a little bit to continue ❤
8/5/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's great to hear 💋💋💋
8/5/19, 13:29 - Sara: They said that my back seemed stronger
8/5/19, 13:29 - Sara: And i was like ???? Really ????
8/5/19, 13:29 - Sara: XD
8/5/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: back? xd

8/5/19, 13:30 - Sara: I’ll have a shower
8/5/19, 13:31 - Sara: Talk to you later :)
8/5/19, 13:31 - Sara: If you need something, here i am ♥
8/5/19, 13:46 - Sara: Por cierto, te apetece una cita esta tarde o esta noche?
8/5/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: esta noche, por supuesto ❤
8/5/19, 13:50 - Sara: ♥
8/5/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: El camino del corazón pasa por el estómago ❤️❤️❤️
8/5/19, 14:28 - Sara: Hahaha yeah, lo recordaste :D
8/5/19, 14:29 - Sara: Completamente de acuerdo
8/5/19, 14:29 - Sara: Comida > todo
8/5/19, 14:29 - Sara: Fuiste a la oficina?
8/5/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí, estoy ahí ahora
8/5/19, 14:31 - Sara: Esperando mucho tiempo?
8/5/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí... 😐
8/5/19, 14:36 - Sara: Oh
8/5/19, 14:36 - Sara: Pobre Kamil
8/5/19, 14:36 - Sara: Seguro que acabas pronto
8/5/19, 14:37 - Sara: I know now that the more a person with vagina masturbates, the more libido they have
8/5/19, 14:37 - Sara: The opposite with people with penis (?
8/5/19, 14:37 - Sara: So that is nice 🌝
8/5/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: No lo sé 😂
8/5/19, 14:38 - Sara: Hahahaha
8/5/19, 14:39 - Sara: It was not a question
8/5/19, 14:39 - Sara: Like my ex’s bestfriend’s mother is sexologist and they told them that
8/5/19, 14:39 - Sara: But idk, it is weird
8/5/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Finalmente 😁
8/5/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Voy a volver a casa
8/5/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nos vemos 💋
8/5/19, 14:40 - Sara: Genial!
8/5/19, 14:40 - Sara: Adios a tu id belga :(
8/5/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
8/5/19, 14:40 - Sara: Siempre seras polaco 😈
8/5/19, 14:41 - Sara: Por cierto, tendré mi casa sola todas las mañanas hasta el viernes 🌝
8/5/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Estupendo...
8/5/19, 14:46 - Sara: Yayyy fiesta
8/5/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Solo las mañanas?
8/5/19, 15:32 - Sara: A ver
8/5/19, 15:32 - Sara: Sola en casa, sí
8/5/19, 15:33 - Sara: Puedo estar también sola en mi habitación cuando están mis padres
8/5/19, 15:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant, you will be alone only in the mornings?
8/5/19, 15:39 - Sara: Yes
8/5/19, 15:39 - Sara: Because my parents work in the morning and my sister will be gone until monday
8/5/19, 15:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, until what time, more or less?
8/5/19, 15:40 - Sara: 9-2/3
8/5/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: genial 🌝
8/5/19, 15:40 - Sara: How are you?
8/5/19, 15:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: fine, studying a bit
8/5/19, 15:42 - Sara: That is fine
8/5/19, 15:42 - Sara: I’ll have time soon
8/5/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can do something around 4:30
8/5/19, 15:42 - Sara: Okaay
8/5/19, 15:42 - Sara: Maybe later, i want to do some stuff first
8/5/19, 15:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👌
8/5/19, 15:46 - Sara: I call you 💋
8/5/19, 16:52 - Sara: I’ll wait to my sister leaving (i won’t see her until next week) and i call you, in about 30 min or less
8/5/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/9BMwcO6_hyA
8/5/19, 18:37 - Sara: Thanks :)
8/5/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
8/5/19, 18:42 - Sara: I feel bad because you have been doing comments about parts of my body out of context, and i literally think you consider me only that. Boobs and an ass you can see and touch as, you showed me, a videogame
8/5/19, 18:43 - Sara: Also again, lack of interest of my
opinions and thoughts by not asking or not leting me talk
8/5/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: You know that this is not true, most of the time I do it in the joking manner, I didn't know that it hurts you, I'm sorry
8/5/19, 18:45 - Sara: How should i know?
8/5/19, 18:45 - Sara: You miss me because you cannot touch them or something
8/5/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought that by now you know that I value you in many ways, your body is one of these things but not even close to actually important
8/5/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I miss your smile, being close to you, talking in person, discussing about all sorts of topics, going out, dancing, actually being there for you
8/5/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I miss everything about you, don't reduce me to someone who misses only your boobs
8/5/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's rather difficult to capture with words how I miss you
8/5/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm sorry that I gave you an impression that it's only about sex
8/5/19, 18:51 - Sara: It is okay
8/5/19, 18:51 - Sara: It is still something i struggle with
8/5/19, 18:52 - Sara: Saying these comments and not caring about me makes me doubt sometimes
8/5/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again you tell me that I don't care about you, I don't know what to do to change that, it seems to never be enough
8/5/19, 18:55 - Sara: Let me talk
8/5/19, 18:56 - Sara: Ask me “and you?”
8/5/19, 18:56 - Sara: It is only that
8/5/19, 18:57 - Sara: Sorry, i think we should talk in another moment
8/5/19, 18:57 - Sara: I don’t want you to feel like that, it is not my intention
8/5/19, 18:59 - Sara: But i have also my right to say how i feel 😞
8/5/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry but after everything that happened so far you tell me that I care only about having sex with you, it hurts me
8/5/19, 19:00 - Sara: I did not say that
8/5/19, 19:00 - Sara: But sorry for my words
8/5/19, 19:00 - Sara: I take in consideration everything you have done for us and for me
8/5/19, 19:01 - Sara: But when i don’t a comment, i don’t like it
8/5/19, 19:01 - Sara: Like*
8/5/19, 19:02 - Sara: How do you feel?
8/5/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will study now
8/5/19, 19:02 - Sara: Okay 😞
8/5/19, 22:33 - Sara: Czy masz ochotę rozmawiać?
8/5/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, just finished working on the thesis for now
8/5/19, 22:37 - Sara: I try to call you asap
8/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/6/19, 00:04 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/6/19, 13:16 - Sara: Hey Kamil, how is it going?
8/6/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wrapped up things with my promoter and now I'm ready to leave Belgium, nothing else to do
8/6/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
8/6/19, 13:22 - Sara: Better, but still confused
8/6/19, 13:22 - Sara: Blood analysis were okay👌🏻
8/6/19, 13:23 - Sara: Now i have to go to the anesthesist
8/6/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good, so maybe soon they will fix your knee
8/6/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy for you
8/6/19, 13:25 - Sara: Yes, i hope everything is okay
8/6/19, 13:25 - Sara: How are youV
8/6/19, 13:25 - Sara: ?
8/6/19, 13:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine, nothing worth mentioning
8/6/19, 13:26 - Sara: I’m sure it is worth
8/6/19, 13:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing?
8/6/19, 13:27 - Sara: Physically i feel tired, also weak
8/6/19, 13:27 - Sara: Probably related to my mood
8/6/19, 13:28 - Sara: I want to organize my mind
8/6/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You couldn't eat and you didn't sleep much, understandable
8/6/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, tell me later what you decide
8/6/19, 13:30 - Sara: The same, if you want to say something
8/6/19, 13:30 - Sara: Be free
8/6/19, 13:42 - Sara: I’ll have the surgery in 2 days...
8/6/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: The sooner the better, good
8/6/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: You'll be running around in no time
8/6/19, 13:43 - Sara: Yes ♥
8/6/19, 14:46 - Sara: Hey babe, i have just left the anesthesist office
8/6/19, 14:47 - Sara: General anesthesia for 1-1:30h of surgery
8/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: I felt dizzy when i have known it
8/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: But it is going to be okay
8/6/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't sound too bad and it fixes a problem, so that's good
8/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: Probably i’ll have to wear a sanitary napkin
8/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: That is the worse xD
8/6/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure everything will be fine
8/6/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is it?
8/6/19, 14:49 - Sara: Yes, that keeps me calm
8/6/19, 14:50 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/6/19, 14:50 - Sara: My period will come or tomorrow or on thursday
8/6/19, 14:51 - Sara: And everything has to be external
8/6/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be fine, the doctors deal with far worse things than some menstrual blood
8/6/19, 14:51 - Sara: No, yeah, of course
8/6/19, 14:52 - Sara: The doctors who will be with me most of them are women, so it is not that bad
8/6/19, 14:52 - Sara: But the sanitary napkin... hahaha just joking
8/6/19, 14:52 - Sara: And for only one hour...
8/6/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you know at what time you will have the surgery?
8/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: Nop, they will call me tomorrow or even on thursday
8/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: Again, i cannot eat on thursday
8/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: I hope knowing it soon haha
8/6/19, 14:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: You will be staying in the hospital after for a few days or not?
8/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: Not at all
8/6/19, 14:54 - Sara: Nor befor or after
8/6/19, 14:54 - Sara: Before*
8/6/19, 14:54 - Sara: So that is nice
8/6/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good
8/6/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing?
8/6/19, 14:55 - Sara: Fine, i’ll have lunch with my parents now
8/6/19, 14:55 - Sara: You?
8/6/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/6/19, 14:55 - Sara: Beautiful ♥
8/6/19, 14:56 - Sara: The next episode of the documentary is about Charles V
8/6/19, 14:56 - Sara: 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
8/6/19, 14:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: How many do you have left?
8/6/19, 14:57 - Sara: There should be 4
8/6/19, 14:57 - Sara: But available at the moment 2
8/6/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: After that maybe you should try teaching history instead of english
8/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: I really like American History
8/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: So i don’t reject tha
8/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: That* :B
8/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: You can teach me the polish one :B
8/6/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: When I finish the book on two years...
8/6/19, 15:07 - Sara: How thick is it? XD
8/6/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure, I have it on my phone so pages are smaller than normally
8/6/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: But on my phone it's over 2000 pages
8/6/19, 15:09 - Sara: Damn haha that is a lot
8/6/19, 15:10 - Sara: Are you okay?
8/6/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine, you?
8/6/19, 15:13 - Sara: Quite better
8/6/19, 15:13 - Sara: Relieved, indeed
8/6/19, 15:13 - Sara: I would like to talk with you later
8/6/19, 15:14 - Sara: If you want, of course
8/6/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, no problem
8/6/19, 15:17 - Sara: Sure?
8/6/19, 15:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/6/19, 15:52 - Sara: Thanks a lot ♥

8/6/19, 21:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: and children are pretty stupid 😆 so they probably tried to become spider man too
8/6/19, 21:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: by getting bitten by a spider
8/6/19, 21:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wonder how that worked out in Australia...
8/6/19, 21:49 - Sara: Puf
8/6/19, 21:49 - Sara: Did they really try? XD
8/6/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, it was just a random thought xd

8/8/19, 15:30 - Sara: Did you sleep?
8/8/19, 15:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: No
8/8/19, 15:32 - Sara: Really? Why?😕
8/8/19, 15:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Didn't feel like and I was fighting with my luggage
8/8/19, 15:35 - Sara: Too many things and little space?
8/8/19, 15:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much
8/8/19, 15:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/8/19, 15:35 - Sara: I remember you told me to sit on it
8/8/19, 15:36 - Sara: And it worked :p
8/8/19, 15:36 - Sara: Did you try?
8/8/19, 15:36 - Sara: Could you put everything inside?
8/8/19, 15:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was able to close it but it was too heavy
8/8/19, 15:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I had to leave most of the papers
8/8/19, 15:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's not a big loss
8/8/19, 15:37 - Sara: Important once? Not notes, rught?
8/8/19, 15:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, stuff that I have on my computer anyway
8/8/19, 15:38 - Sara: Okay not bad then

8/8/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Empty inside
8/8/19, 15:40 - Sara: Why?😕
8/8/19, 15:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: No reason whatsoever
8/8/19, 15:44 - Sara: Do not lie, please
8/8/19, 15:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said you wanted to talk about something
8/8/19, 15:45 - Sara: When?
8/8/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, maybe I misunderstood, when I was in the security check
8/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Just i feel like talking with you
8/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Helping you
8/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Knowing how are you

8/8/19, 15:51 - Sara: Welcome
8/8/19, 15:51 - Sara: But up to you
8/8/19, 15:51 - Sara: I do not want to disturb you or anything
8/8/19, 15:51 - Sara: I’ll respect if you decide not to talk
8/8/19, 15:52 - Sara: Talkimg with you makes me feel you are doing me a visit
8/8/19, 15:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, you're just trying to chit-chat like nothing happened
8/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: Tell me
8/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: More
8/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: If you do not want to, it is okay
8/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: Sorry
8/8/19, 15:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: What was that thing that you were doing in the morning, before the surgery?
8/8/19, 15:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just because you were nervous or why?
8/8/19, 15:56 - Sara: 😔
8/8/19, 15:56 - Sara: Forget it
8/8/19, 15:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be harsh
8/8/19, 15:57 - Sara: It is okay
8/8/19, 15:57 - Sara: But forget it
8/8/19, 15:57 - Sara: Sorry
8/8/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't give me hope like this if you're going to change your mind in a few hours, please
8/8/19, 15:59 - Sara: Okay
8/8/19, 15:59 - Sara: Sorry
8/8/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seriously, what was it about?
8/8/19, 16:01 - Sara: Nothing
8/8/19, 16:01 - Sara: I don’t feel like talking about that now
8/8/19, 16:01 - Sara: I feel embarrased
8/8/19, 16:02 - Sara: Maybe it is anesthesia or whatever
8/8/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy that you have some great people around you to support you now, sorry for bringing up that topic
8/8/19, 16:08 - Sara: I wish you could be here
8/8/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel strong enough to see you in person now
8/8/19, 16:09 - Sara: Why?
8/8/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you've made a decision, your life will be different now, probably better
8/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: I wanted a stand-by
8/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: Better? I’ll see. I want to tidy my mind
8/8/19, 16:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
8/8/19, 16:11 - Sara: It is as untidy as your room in Ghent. Even worse :p
8/8/19, 16:11 - Sara: I think it is the correct word (?
8/8/19, 16:11 - Sara: Just knowing where i an on the map
8/8/19, 16:11 - Sara: What i want and need
8/8/19, 16:12 - Sara: Everything was overwhelming me
8/8/19, 16:12 - Sara: And i don’t want you to suffer flr that
8/8/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Too late for that
8/8/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But don't worry, I'll manage
8/8/19, 16:13 - Sara: 😔
8/8/19, 16:14 - Sara: Focus on yourself
8/8/19, 16:14 - Sara: Your life is there
8/8/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, I don't have much of a choice
8/8/19, 16:17 - Sara: But Kamil, do you feel weak because your uni problems?
8/8/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing is working in my life at the moment
8/8/19, 16:17 - Sara: You don’t fight when your problems appear? When people you care are hurt?
8/8/19, 16:18 - Sara: I’m sure some work
8/8/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
8/8/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Best year of my life is over and everything connected to it just hurts me now
8/8/19, 16:22 - Sara: I don’t want to hurt you
8/8/19, 16:23 - Sara: I want to be there for you
8/8/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, maybe when I get some sleep I'll feel better
8/8/19, 16:32 - Sara: I hope
8/8/19, 16:32 - Sara: Maybe i will better soon as well
8/8/19, 16:32 - Sara: And think with clarity
8/8/19, 16:35 - Sara: Guada confuses me
8/8/19, 16:36 - Sara: Arg everything
8/8/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess he misses you, can't say I blame him for that
8/8/19, 16:49 - Sara: 😔
8/8/19, 16:49 - Sara: Am i doing wrong? Right?
8/8/19, 16:49 - Sara: I miss you
8/8/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Wrong what?
8/8/19, 16:51 - Sara: This
8/8/19, 16:51 - Sara: But i prefer knowing it asap
8/8/19, 16:51 - Sara: I’ll have time to think
8/8/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You followed your heart and made a decision, time will tell if it was good or not
8/8/19, 16:52 - Sara: There is always a fear of regreting
8/8/19, 16:53 - Sara: I do not want to lose you
8/8/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, now you have to ex-boyfriends to worry about
8/8/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'll do my best to not confuse you
8/8/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will accept whatever you do
8/8/19, 16:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Two*
8/8/19, 16:56 - Sara: Great... 💔💔💔
8/8/19, 16:56 - Sara: Thanks
8/8/19, 16:56 - Sara: I hate considering you my ex
8/8/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now when you talk about your ex you have to specify which one
8/8/19, 16:58 - Sara: x,)
8/8/19, 16:58 - Sara: Please Kamil 😭😂
8/8/19, 16:58 - Sara: Mixture of feelings
8/8/19, 16:59 - Sara: (In a good way)
8/8/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/JWdZEumNRmI
8/8/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't have to ask me how am I anymore
8/8/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: This pretty much summarizes it
8/8/19, 17:33 - Sara: I’ll listen to it
8/8/19, 17:44 - Sara: I feel the same 💔
8/8/19, 19:08 - Sara: Btw, thanks for the support during the surgery
8/8/19, 19:08 - Sara: Very few people did
8/8/19, 19:08 - Sara: I really appreciate it
8/8/19, 19:09 - Sara: You are great
8/8/19, 20:17 - Sara: Already in Poland?
8/8/19, 20:31 - Sara: I thought i was going to sleep here but i’m going home soon
8/8/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just because I'm feeling bad doesn't mean I don't care, I want only the best for you
8/8/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Arrived 20 minutes ago
8/8/19, 20:40 - Sara: How are you now?

8/8/19, 20:55 - Sara: I hope
8/8/19, 20:55 - Sara: I want to be there
8/8/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to help me, figure out your own problems, please
8/8/19, 20:59 - Sara: I will, i promise
8/8/19, 21:00 - Sara: How is it going?
8/8/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: In a bus to Lodz
8/8/19, 21:00 - Sara: What are you feeling?
8/8/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope you find someone who will love you and accept you and let you be free and be yourself like I couldn't

8/8/19, 21:04 - Sara: And i told you i want you there
8/8/19, 21:05 - Sara: First, do not misunderstand me
8/8/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do not understand this part
8/8/19, 21:07 - Sara: Sara is me 😂 sorry
8/8/19, 21:08 - Sara: Like i was asking your help a lot, too much
8/8/19, 21:08 - Sara: And each of us have a life, so i assumed this is my fight
8/8/19, 21:08 - Sara: I do not agree too much, but it is sonething i have to deal with
8/8/19, 21:10 - Sara: I have been always dependent
8/8/19, 21:13 - Sara: And if i want to do something, i want to do it 100% sure
8/8/19, 21:13 - Sara: Not lying to my self, not to the one i love

8/8/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like the whole day
8/8/19, 22:36 - Sara: did you sleep?
8/8/19, 22:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: A little bit in the plane and the bus
8/8/19, 22:37 - Sara: and are you better?
8/8/19, 22:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: No

8/8/19, 22:38 - Sara: sure?
8/8/19, 22:38 - Sara: do you want me to stop talking to you?
8/8/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk
8/8/19, 22:42 - Sara: tell me
8/8/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/4jAyZ4njHsc
8/8/19, 23:25 - Sara: What do you mean with that?
8/8/19, 23:27 - Sara: 😣
8/8/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why does everything has to remind me of you?
8/8/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sitting in the bus and I'm thinking about Netherlands trip
8/8/19, 23:43 - Sara: Tell me
8/8/19, 23:43 - Sara: What are you thinking about the trip?
8/8/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: The bus back to Ghent
8/8/19, 23:49 - Sara: Why that bus?
8/8/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: You, sleeping in my arms
8/8/19, 23:50 - Sara: Aw true ♥
8/8/19, 23:50 - Sara: Such a beautiful place to be
8/8/19, 23:53 - Sara: I loved that trip and sleeping with yoy
8/8/19, 23:53 - Sara: You*
8/8/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is painful to remember now
8/8/19, 23:56 - Sara: I don’t want to be a painful memory 😣
8/9/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope it gets better with time
8/9/19, 00:39 - Sara: Me too
8/9/19, 00:39 - Sara: I really want to
8/9/19, 00:39 - Sara: I wish i had a ticket to Warsov, really
8/9/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what if that would be a good idea
8/9/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: You made a choice, why cling to what is now past
8/9/19, 01:14 - Sara: It is something i really need
8/9/19, 01:14 - Sara: Seeing you
8/9/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/9/19, 01:35 - Sara: Because i’m still loving you, want to hug you, to realise that i’m not alone and you neither
8/9/19, 01:37 - Sara: There was a very nice nurse during the surgery, the one telling me about the anesthesia
8/9/19, 01:38 - Sara: He told me “think about something that makes you happy, because if you sleep thinking about that, you will remember ir when you wake up. Any trip you did?”
8/9/19, 01:38 - Sara: Thinking about trips “oh, i loved Norway”
8/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: Later, he mentioned again the topic with his colleges “she will be so happy now when thinking about Norway”
8/9/19, 01:39 - Sara: “No way. I thought about a trip, but my home is really Belgium, Ghent”
8/9/19, 01:40 - Sara: So i slept thinking, if i remember correctly, about the moment of our feet in the wall
8/9/19, 01:41 - Sara: No doubts
8/9/19, 01:42 - Sara: I also watch a video in youtube,  curiously added in a list a time ago, about what is true love
8/9/19, 01:43 - Sara: The speaker mentioned sacrifice
8/9/19, 01:44 - Sara: I think the word was selected wrongly but i could get the idea
8/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: But it is about selecting the best for us, what is really significant
8/9/19, 01:45 - Sara: And i will have that idea in mins for a long time to reflect
8/9/19, 01:47 - Sara: I’m afraid, if i decide, about going back to you and you turning page
8/9/19, 01:47 - Sara: But i’m getting nearer to answers, i hope
8/9/19, 01:48 - Sara: Kamil, tell me if you need your space and your time, not talking to me, block me, not seeing my photos
8/9/19, 01:49 - Sara: I’ll do it for you, but at the same time i’ll still reflecting about this
8/9/19, 01:50 - Sara: About you being okay, about being couple or being friends
8/9/19, 01:51 - Sara: You are too special for me to forget easily or to set aside
8/9/19, 01:51 - Sara: Maybe i’m not helping, but i needes to say it
8/9/19, 01:52 - Sara: I’m happy that you arrived safe to Poland, really
8/9/19, 01:53 - Sara: And i want you to keep the faith and to be proud of yourself, you’ll get what you want
8/9/19, 01:55 - Sara: Sleep tight and bienvenido a Polonia
8/9/19, 01:55 - Sara: Just tell me if I’m not helping you by doing this. I’ll understand it
8/9/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, it's been only one day, at the moment I just feel broken
8/9/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just too much, losing everything in one day
8/9/19, 12:12 - Sara: You did not lose me
8/9/19, 12:31 - Sara: Please do not think that
8/9/19, 12:32 - Sara: This is because i need to know what i want, to collocate everything in my mind
8/9/19, 12:39 - Sara: How are you?
8/9/19, 13:17 - Sara: I want to see you, to help you
8/9/19, 14:41 - Sara: Kamil?
8/9/19, 16:13 - Sara: Please...
8/9/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is you rehab going?
8/9/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your*
8/9/19, 23:01 - Sara: Well, it is not the best but not bad
8/9/19, 23:01 - Sara: What about you?
8/9/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: How long will it take?
8/9/19, 23:05 - Sara: 4 weeks
8/9/19, 23:05 - Sara: How are you?
8/9/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: So longer than initially expected
8/9/19, 23:07 - Sara: Yes... more or less
8/9/19, 23:07 - Sara: I expected time but 4 weeks without putting my foot on the ground
8/9/19, 23:07 - Sara: It is a lot
8/9/19, 23:07 - Sara: And having injections 😓
8/9/19, 23:07 - Sara: Tell me, please. How are you?
8/9/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: You cannot walk, not even a little?
8/9/19, 23:10 - Sara: With crutchea
8/9/19, 23:10 - Sara: I must not put my left foot on ghe ground, specially emphasized
8/9/19, 23:10 - Sara: Crutches*
8/9/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's hard, but at least it leads to improvement
8/9/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure you can do it
8/9/19, 23:11 - Sara: Yes, of course
8/9/19, 23:11 - Sara: Thanks :)
8/9/19, 23:11 - Sara: How is Poland? Cold?
8/9/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't feel like home anymore
8/9/19, 23:13 - Sara: Tell me
8/9/19, 23:18 - Sara: Tbh, there is something missing here as well
8/9/19, 23:21 - Sara: Someone, rather than something
8/9/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same
8/9/19, 23:27 - Sara: Can i help you?
8/9/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think so, unfortunately
8/9/19, 23:32 - Sara: Why?
8/9/19, 23:33 - Sara: Tell me how you feel, i’m sure we feel the same
8/9/19, 23:35 - Sara: This is horrible
8/9/19, 23:36 - Sara: I’m sure that if we talk, we can get to another idea
8/9/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Every sad song feels relatable now and I hate that
8/9/19, 23:38 - Sara: Please, Kamil...
8/9/19, 23:38 - Sara: I’m sure we can get to the same point
8/9/19, 23:38 - Sara: And i needed to think, and i need
8/9/19, 23:40 - Sara: But it is up to you, i don’t want to annoy
8/9/19, 23:41 - Sara: I know that you must be really hurt
8/9/19, 23:42 - Sara: And i really miss you
8/9/19, 23:45 - Sara: If you need time, just tell me and i let you alone
8/9/19, 23:45 - Sara: But i will fight until the end, and to solve the problem
8/9/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is no problem, it's just what you want to do and I accept that
8/9/19, 23:49 - Sara: Kamil, what do i want?
8/9/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, but it's something else than what we had and that's fine
8/9/19, 23:50 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/9/19, 23:51 - Sara: Some things are getting clearer, thank God
8/9/19, 23:51 - Sara: Others i need more time
8/9/19, 23:51 - Sara: But i miss you, that’s a fact
8/9/19, 23:53 - Sara: That i don’t want to lose you
8/10/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: How's it going?
8/10/19, 22:37 - Sara: It is just going
8/10/19, 22:37 - Sara: You?
8/10/19, 22:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: A whole lot of nothing
8/10/19, 22:38 - Sara: Tell me
8/10/19, 22:38 - Sara: What are you going these days?
8/10/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Literally nothing, there is nothing here
8/10/19, 22:39 - Sara: No running, no studying, no going out?
8/10/19, 22:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
8/10/19, 22:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I went to the swimming pool
8/10/19, 22:40 - Sara: Oh, and how was it?
8/10/19, 22:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot of water
8/10/19, 22:41 - Sara: Ha ha ha :p
8/10/19, 22:41 - Sara: That is obvious!
8/10/19, 22:41 - Sara: Did you swim a lot?
8/10/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: About 1 km
8/10/19, 22:41 - Sara: That is nice
8/10/19, 22:42 - Sara: And what are you doing now?
8/10/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing
8/10/19, 22:42 - Sara: Have you thought?
8/10/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: About what?
8/10/19, 22:43 - Sara: About...us
8/10/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
8/10/19, 22:45 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/10/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: That I don't know what I want and what to do anymore
8/10/19, 22:45 - Sara: Why?
8/10/19, 22:47 - Sara: Tell me, please
8/10/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think I will, I don't even know what to say
8/10/19, 22:48 - Sara: You will never now?
8/10/19, 22:49 - Sara: I have written some thoughts, tbh
8/10/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, at least at the moment I don't feel comfortable enough to do that
8/10/19, 22:50 - Sara: Okay
8/10/19, 22:50 - Sara: I’ll give you some space if you want
8/10/19, 22:50 - Sara: But i want to help
8/10/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me what you think
8/10/19, 22:50 - Sara: Maybe if i tell you what i think and feel, it can help you
8/10/19, 22:51 - Sara: Later
8/10/19, 22:51 - Sara: I have visit and i need to complete it
8/10/19, 22:58 - Sara: But you will have it
8/10/19, 22:58 - Sara: If you need space, tell me
8/11/19, 16:00 - Sara: How are you?
8/11/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing new, you?
8/11/19, 16:07 - Sara: Why nothing new?
8/11/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same as the last few days, nothing changes here
8/11/19, 16:08 - Sara: Do you have any routine?
8/11/19, 16:12 - Sara: You don’t want to talk, do you?
8/11/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I'm feeling trapped here and I cannot do anything about it
8/11/19, 16:14 - Sara: Why not?
8/11/19, 16:15 - Sara: I mean... i have a lot to say
8/11/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Say it
8/11/19, 16:15 - Sara: But do you?
8/11/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just tell me what you have to say, please
8/11/19, 16:17 - Sara: Okay, i'll say it little by little.. i want to revise everything
8/11/19, 16:18 - Sara: Maybe this is inappropiate, but i needed to write this down and to explain the other side of the coin. Then, i’ll let you alone if that’s what you want.
8/11/19, 16:20 - Sara: I don’t know what is going on in your mind: hate, sadness, desperation, emptiness, nostalgy… but this situation is killing me. You deserve your space, your time, and I respect it (and I hope you are finally taking care of yourself, you deserve it), but you not talking to me means that I have done something wrong, and I want to know it because i’m feeling quite bad without solving it. I’m feeling that i did not help you, i was not there when you needed me (and i’m not there right now). All the thesis stuff and your future… i failed you as a couple and as a friend. Now that it is not too late (I hope) I want to 1) help you, trying to be by your side, to give you my piece of advice or just send you meme 2) Fix this.
8/11/19, 16:31 - Sara: What is this? You can say. All this situation.I think everything starts with me needing help, that is not a mystery or something to hide. Yes, It is hard to ask for help. In fact, I do the opposite, i run away from the people I care about for not hurting them and for shame. During some days i was full of doubts and fears about me, you, us, him, and i did/don’t know what to do with them. Indirectly, when I called you  on Wednesday, I needed you. And I cared about you but this cloud I had in my mind was too huge to handle it and it fell over me spontaneously, i didn’t expect saying what i said.  If I was feeling bad, now it is worse: not going out for 10 days minimum with pain in my leg while being dependent, low self-steem, seeing myself physically horrible and not knowing what is going to happen, having you far away while thinking about how happy we were on Ghent and how we could be in the future, sense of loneliness because my friends do not adapt their plans for me and doubting if they  can really understand me, my ex being sad and confused for this same situation… now i don’t feel anything anymore. I feel weak, not talking or crying. Just being there, lying on the bed, not thinking about the outside world. At least there are some things i can find out.
8/11/19, 16:40 - Sara: If I’m honest, there was a conversation that marked me a lot. The one we had when I was not okay while you going out. You told me that we should live our respective lifes. From that moment on, i felt that i was to you a constant handicap because I needed you and I felt dependent, that I needed you to be better. And the question is, are we capable of helping the other one when we need it? Or should we be the ones controlling our feelings and finding the balance? What is the limit? I have noticed you weak, indiferent recently (was it because you are dealing with a bad moment or because you are like that?). Maybe that made me give up: it was a situation of you not helping me and giving up easily and, consequently, me not helping you and feeling that i cannot do anything else, that i cannot make you happy.  How much do you fight for your mental health and for us? Could not help me because you did not want to or besucase you were not able to do that?  And important questions,  Do you really asked (me) for help when you were sad? Do you trust me? Was it reciprocate? Why all the important decisions depended on me? In my case, I feel like a ghost wandering around somewhere without an aim, without strength. I hope this is tempory, I hope this can have an easy solution.
8/11/19, 16:44 - Sara: About my external problems: about my ex… Damn. Finally I realized it is better for both of us not being a couple again. We should not. There is (was?) a sexual tension. And only that. Both of us recognized that we are better as friends than a couple, and also he likes Raquel, why should i be in the middle fucking up everything? We should let each other move on and put into practice what we already know, but at the same time i feel like we should help each other as friends. And about the open relationships… this is tougher. But thougher is having destroyed, already, two relationships for this. How important is to sexually experiment with random people when you have stability and someone you love? Of course people can deal with both, but can I? Is it something that we cannot change or rather it is something that people do not want to change? Tbh, i’m too sad and too broken that this topic is totally out from my mind right now. i prevfr fixing me and my relationships.
8/11/19, 16:53 - Sara: Kamil, i don’t know what to do. Is this situation of ours temporary or it is going to last longer? Is this because there is a bigger problem or because we are realising that not being next to the other is hard? Am i like this for my surgery, for my period, because i’m normally like this? Are you ready for a relationship? Am i ready for a relationship? From one hand I think having my own time for recovering and that we can be nice being friends, that i’m putting more effort the you in this situation. However, other part of me says that I would be better if i see you, hug you, kiss you and I want to fight for this relationship, no matter what owing to i have not tried enough for it. Should we fix ourselves first and then care about the others? Having a couple would help us to recover? And what about if someone of us hurt the other after being back together again? Our purpose in life is different? I’m really afraid of hurting you more, but i’m not afraid of not seeing or talking ot you again.
8/11/19, 16:55 - Sara: What do you think? How do you feel? I cannot stop thinking about that, i cannot stop thinking about you
8/11/19, 16:55 - Sara: I'm sorry for everything
8/11/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a lot of doubts, before I decide anything I have to find out if I can still trust you and I have a lot of other unrelated problems, all of this I'm afraid may cloud my judgement. You should figure out what it is that you want because I don't want to go through losing you again, once was already too much, I need to have more hope that it can actually survive before I can commit to anything again
8/11/19, 17:14 - Sara: Is this a goodbye?
8/11/19, 17:15 - Sara: Why don’t you trust me?
8/11/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You were saying a lot about love and caring but in the end it didn't really matter that much to you, now you say otherwise but I don't know what to believe now
8/11/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't mind to keep talking
8/11/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will probably need some time
8/11/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: To figure things out
8/11/19, 17:18 - Sara: Do you think i don’t love you?
8/11/19, 17:19 - Sara: Up to you
8/11/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know anymore
8/11/19, 17:19 - Sara: Why it didn’t matter to me?
8/11/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Other things that you wanted turned out to be more important than our relationship, but that's fine, I failed you many times and I understand that
8/11/19, 17:21 - Sara: Is it more important? Really?
8/11/19, 17:21 - Sara: When have you failed me?
8/11/19, 17:23 - Sara: Gosh, Kamil. Are you blaming me for everything?
8/11/19, 17:25 - Sara: Were you keeping all of this without saying it to me?
8/11/19, 17:26 - Sara: Realising about what was happening in my life is not important?
8/11/19, 17:27 - Sara: While dealing with a long distance relationship, which is also quite hard
8/11/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, this was a fairly new development, we didn't really have time to talk about it because we broke up
8/11/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was affecting me a lot, almost every day I felt like it was the last day for us
8/11/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I didn't know what to do
8/11/19, 17:29 - Sara: And why did you keep it for yourself?
8/11/19, 17:30 - Sara: No time for solving it?
8/11/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I was far and I couldn't do anything bout it
8/11/19, 17:30 - Sara: Is it always about being near to help the others?
8/11/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe not always but it became quite clear that a long distance relationship is quite difficult
8/11/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Many times I wished I could be there, next to you
8/11/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it tormented me a lot to not be able to do that
8/11/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I could see you get further away, and I couldn't do anything
8/11/19, 17:32 - Sara: Why? How?
8/11/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: You had more problems, more doubts, you realized how important physical connection is
8/11/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I tried but I didn't know how to help
8/11/19, 17:35 - Sara: Physical connection with the ones i care and i love
8/11/19, 17:35 - Sara: And i need you there to help me, and at the same time you want me to help you
8/11/19, 17:35 - Sara: But i felt you gave up so fast...
8/11/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: When you said you wanted an open relationship and decided to break up, I'm not going to oppose
8/11/19, 17:37 - Sara: I did not say that
8/11/19, 17:37 - Sara: It is a topic i have in mind, not lying
8/11/19, 17:38 - Sara: But if i needed time is because i’m fucking lost and lonely
8/11/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: You didn't give me much other reason and later I wasn't able to even think properly
8/11/19, 17:38 - Sara: Maybe it was misunderstood that i have a mess
8/11/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: And because of loneliness you ran away?
8/11/19, 17:40 - Sara: If i have my problems and you have more, am i helping you?
8/11/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it better to just give up and leave?
8/11/19, 17:40 - Sara: Not at all
8/11/19, 17:41 - Sara: But you were so sad and so passive as well... idk
8/11/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: If my problems were such an issue I could have just gave you your space
8/11/19, 17:43 - Sara: Why? I want to help you
8/11/19, 17:43 - Sara: And i want you to be happy
8/11/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you do than what does this mean?
8/11/19, 17:44 - Sara: I was like that too?
8/11/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I wanted to help you too
8/11/19, 17:44 - Sara: You helped me
8/11/19, 17:45 - Sara: Maybe i was too scared of everything
8/11/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know Sara, maybe we can try again later, but first I will try to get better
8/11/19, 17:47 - Sara: What happened? 😖
8/11/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just have to solve my problems, I don't want you to feel that I don't care when I'm dealing with them
8/11/19, 17:49 - Sara: Let me help you
8/11/19, 17:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have to do it myself
8/11/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel lonely and you need a friend I can call you later
8/11/19, 17:50 - Sara: You need your space, you told me
8/11/19, 17:50 - Sara: I’ll do the same
8/11/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm feeling better, I can try to do my best to help you
8/11/19, 17:51 - Sara: Do you need a friend also?
8/11/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do, but I also need someone here, we'll see, I'm going to meet a friend next week, hopefully it will be nice
8/11/19, 17:53 - Sara: Oh, that is nice
8/11/19, 17:53 - Sara: I’m happy that you are meeting your friends from there
8/11/19, 17:55 - Sara: Need someone there?
8/11/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
8/11/19, 17:58 - Sara: I meant like, why do you need someone there?
8/11/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you need friends?
8/11/19, 17:59 - Sara: Misunderstood, sorry
8/11/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem
8/11/19, 18:00 - Sara: I felt weird, that’s it
8/11/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/11/19, 18:01 - Sara: Idk 😂
8/11/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
8/11/19, 18:02 - Sara: I felt set aside, but it is normal
8/11/19, 18:03 - Sara: I mean, i’m your ex and i’m in another place. I understand it 😂
8/11/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Set aside? You went out all the time
8/11/19, 18:05 - Sara: Not in that sense
8/11/19, 18:05 - Sara: What else do you have inside, Kamil?
8/11/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't feel set aside, I was happy that you were reconnecting with your friends
8/11/19, 18:06 - Sara: I’m happy for you too
8/11/19, 18:07 - Sara: Fuck, why i am fucking everything up again? I’m afraid
8/11/19, 18:08 - Sara: I felt like for you it is an obligation having contact with me or something
8/11/19, 18:08 - Sara: Well, sorry. I won’t disturb.
8/11/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll call you in the evening
8/11/19, 18:16 - Sara: I won’t force you
8/11/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/11/19, 23:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/12/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: How's it going?

8/12/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: My father wanted to go early but I overslept
8/12/19, 13:15 - Sara: Didn’t he wake you up?
8/12/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll still go a bit later, if not than probably tomorrow or on Wednesday
8/12/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: He did but he overslept too and he was already late

8/13/19, 20:24 - Sara: Is everything okay?
8/13/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: not gonna lie, I've had better days
8/13/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: how are you?
8/13/19, 21:55 - Sara: Well, it was nice
8/13/19, 21:55 - Sara: I could see the light and probably, the solution to everything
8/13/19, 21:56 - Sara: So i think that is nice
8/13/19, 21:56 - Sara: I want to make sure this is realistic and doable and i’ll talk with you about that
8/13/19, 21:57 - Sara: A close friend came and in two hours she opened my mind
8/13/19, 21:58 - Sara: And i’m going out for a bit and i feel like a dog haha it is not that much but it is something
8/13/19, 21:58 - Sara: What about you, tell me?
8/13/19, 21:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: good to hear that it's going well for you, enjoy going out
8/13/19, 21:58 - Sara: I’ll be having dinner in case i do not answer fast
8/13/19, 21:59 - Sara: I want you to enjoy and to be okay too
8/13/19, 22:00 - Sara: If you let me, of course
8/13/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: whenever you're ready
8/13/19, 22:00 - Sara: And yep, i will give you the space you need. Just answer me when you feel like or talk to me,call me if you want
8/13/19, 22:00 - Sara: Okay
8/13/19, 22:00 - Sara: What did you do today?
8/13/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: went to uni, didn't really manage to solve anything, as I expected
8/13/19, 22:16 - Sara: What did they tell you?
8/13/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: not much, I have to get some info from Ghent office
8/13/19, 22:17 - Sara: And what about the internship?
8/13/19, 22:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: unfortunately I didn't manage to get to that office today
8/13/19, 22:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll probably call them soon because I need some other info from them too
8/13/19, 22:18 - Sara: Oh, that is bad
8/13/19, 22:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: but probably after I contact the Ghent one
8/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: Nice
8/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: Little by little
8/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: What do you know now?
8/13/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I went back to the idea of changing my learning agreement
8/13/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to know how many points can they give me for research
8/13/19, 22:22 - Sara: Not the expected ones?
8/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: dean of my faculty told me it's fine for him but if I don't have enough credits I might need to return part of the money
8/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: not sure, last time guy wasn't sure
8/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: and he told me it was rather flexible
8/13/19, 22:22 - Sara: Weird
8/13/19, 22:23 - Sara: Well, that gives hope
8/13/19, 22:24 - Sara: Don’t lose faith ^^
8/13/19, 22:24 - Sara: I think it can be shared whenever we can, so you can give me your opinion
8/13/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: as I said, whenever you want
8/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: Are you okay?
8/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: I mean...
8/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: I think it can help you too
8/13/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm listening
8/13/19, 22:32 - Sara: Can i say it tomorrow?
8/13/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, whenever you want
8/13/19, 22:41 - Sara: Okay
8/13/19, 22:41 - Sara: Thanks
8/13/19, 22:41 - Sara: How can i help?
8/13/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
8/13/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I saw my friend today and he told me that he's moving out of Lodz soon so everything is going perfectly on my side...
8/13/19, 22:57 - Sara: Yasss ♥
8/13/19, 22:57 - Sara: That is really great!
8/13/19, 22:57 - Sara: What did you do?
8/13/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe for him, I'm still staying here...
8/13/19, 23:07 - Sara: Oh, are you not going with him?
8/13/19, 23:07 - Sara: I thought so
8/13/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: basically everyone I knew closer moved somewhere else, so that's great...
8/13/19, 23:10 - Sara: But lodz is nor fat
8/13/19, 23:10 - Sara: Far*
8/13/19, 23:10 - Sara: And you can move there soon
8/13/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: they moved out of Lodz, not to Lodz
8/13/19, 23:13 - Sara: Oh! I misunderstood
8/13/19, 23:13 - Sara: So sorry!
8/13/19, 23:14 - Sara: But again
8/13/19, 23:14 - Sara: Don’t be dramatic
8/13/19, 23:14 - Sara: You can make new friends
8/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: I’m thinking about that
8/13/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: about what?
8/13/19, 23:27 - Sara: Making new friends
8/13/19, 23:37 - Sara: Or what do you think about that?
8/13/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would be nice but at the moment it can be a bit challenging for me
8/13/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps once I move out
8/13/19, 23:38 - Sara: Why challenging?
8/13/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm a bit far from everything, meeting with someone I know from time to time is doable but finding new friends when I physically cannot be there that often, idk
8/13/19, 23:41 - Sara: True
8/13/19, 23:42 - Sara: Also that you want to move on to another place
8/13/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is your first night with one leg going?
8/13/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Night out*
8/13/19, 23:54 - Sara: Nice
8/13/19, 23:54 - Sara: Relaxing
8/13/19, 23:54 - Sara: I needed this to
8/13/19, 23:54 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/13/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing
8/13/19, 23:56 - Sara: Literally nothing?
8/13/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
8/13/19, 23:59 - Sara: No videogames?
8/13/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
8/13/19, 23:59 - Sara: Why nothing?
8/14/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why something?
8/14/19, 00:01 - Sara: Maybe it is weird for me not doing anything
8/14/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm tired, I'll probably go to sleep
8/14/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Enjoy your night
8/14/19, 00:03 - Sara: That soon?
8/14/19, 00:03 - Sara: Are you okay? Do you need something?
8/14/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just tired, have fun
8/14/19, 00:06 - Sara: Sure?
8/14/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure
8/14/19, 00:08 - Sara: Okay
8/14/19, 00:08 - Sara: Dobranoc 🌙
8/14/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good night
8/14/19, 00:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/14/19, 12:51 - Sara: Good morning, Kamil. How are you?
8/14/19, 13:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hi, I'm fine, you?
8/14/19, 13:26 - Sara: Better?
8/14/19, 13:27 - Sara: I’m fine, organizing myself a bit
8/14/19, 13:29 - Sara: Would you like to talk?
8/14/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine for me
8/14/19, 13:30 - Sara: Now, later...?
8/14/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whenever you want
8/14/19, 13:31 - Sara: Now it is okay?
8/14/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/14/19, 13:32 - Sara: Okay, give me a sec
8/14/19, 20:32 - Sara: Better?
8/14/19, 20:57 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/14/19, 21:00 - Sara: dislike*
8/14/19, 21:53 - Sara: Cherry lady on the radio 😭
8/14/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not anymore
8/14/19, 22:49 - Sara: Not anymore? Why?
8/14/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just a memory now and in the end I liked it
8/14/19, 22:53 - Sara: :)
8/14/19, 22:53 - Sara: I swear you will be here soon
8/14/19, 22:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is this place?
8/14/19, 22:53 - Sara: El Retiro park, Madrid
8/14/19, 22:53 - Sara: One of my favourite places 💕
8/14/19, 22:54 - Sara: It Gabriel’s photo haha
8/14/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: What makes you think I will?
8/14/19, 22:54 - Sara: ...
8/14/19, 22:55 - Sara: It is something i would like to do with you
8/14/19, 22:55 - Sara: And yep, idk if soon or ever
8/14/19, 22:55 - Sara: Never*
8/14/19, 22:56 - Sara: But it is something i would like to do
8/14/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure you have a lot of people that would love to do it with you
8/14/19, 22:56 - Sara: Maybe
8/14/19, 22:56 - Sara: But i can be a dream doing it with you
8/14/19, 22:57 - Sara: Are you okay?
8/14/19, 22:57 - Sara: Deal with that
8/14/19, 22:58 - Sara: With my dream, i mean
8/14/19, 22:59 - Sara: Why are you like that with me? What have I done?
8/14/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just painful for me to think about that
8/14/19, 23:01 - Sara: That? How?
8/14/19, 23:05 - Sara: I told you, Kamil. If you need space, if I force you to talk, if you want to ask or to say something, tell me
8/14/19, 23:06 - Sara: Painful is also you talking to me as if i were shit when you know for sure what i feel about you
8/14/19, 23:08 - Sara: Again, if you don’t love me or even if you don’t want to have nothing with me, tell me
8/14/19, 23:10 - Sara: I’m here to help, not to make you suffer
8/14/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: In fairytales they say that love overcomes all obstacles but the longer I think about it the more I think it's just not possible for us to be together, I would like to, but our views are so different that I don't know, one of us would have to abandon part of themselves and that's not something I want for either of us and in the end someone would suffer
8/14/19, 23:14 - Sara: Do you think that?
8/14/19, 23:14 - Sara: I respect it
8/14/19, 23:15 - Sara: Like my view is knowing each other again
8/14/19, 23:15 - Sara: And let things happen, just as friends or whatever
8/14/19, 23:16 - Sara: I’m changing, and that can be good or bad
8/14/19, 23:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can try, but at such distance, I don't know
8/14/19, 23:16 - Sara: Can we not be friends?
8/14/19, 23:17 - Sara: Again, your choice
8/14/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I would like to but I haven't figured out how
8/14/19, 23:18 - Sara: Why is it difficult?
8/14/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why is it difficult for you and Guada?
8/14/19, 23:19 - Sara: Good question
8/14/19, 23:20 - Sara: For me it is not hard if i follow this philosophy, but maybe because we do not know what is goinf to happen (specially his couple stuff)
8/14/19, 23:21 - Sara: Maybe because we do not know how to act, but I told him what I told you: i’ll act without boundaries, neither will he
8/14/19, 23:22 - Sara: Maybe we should focus on the present, what we have
8/14/19, 23:22 - Sara: I’m happy knowing about you, talking and seeing you via messenger
8/14/19, 23:23 - Sara: And if love happens, it will happen. I do not want to feel i’m predetermined for something or another
8/14/19, 23:23 - Sara: Not only love, but also it can work with more people (friends, known people)
8/14/19, 23:24 - Sara: (Of course being both of us okay)
8/14/19, 23:24 - Sara: Love in the sense of relationship
8/14/19, 23:25 - Sara: I have seen my mistakes in all senses
8/14/19, 23:26 - Sara: And i want to solve them, with me you and everybody
8/14/19, 23:28 - Sara: And i feel that strength i lacked of
8/14/19, 23:34 - Sara: But are we in the same line?
8/14/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I've never felt weaker
8/14/19, 23:38 - Sara: What do you need?
8/14/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Legal euthanasia
8/14/19, 23:38 - Sara: Kamil...
8/14/19, 23:38 - Sara: Please
8/14/19, 23:39 - Sara: Let me help you
8/14/19, 23:39 - Sara: I felt like that, and i let myself to be helped
8/14/19, 23:41 - Sara: Please...
8/14/19, 23:47 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/14/19, 23:47 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/15/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was great but it's long gone now
8/15/19, 00:11 - Sara: Well, yes
8/15/19, 00:11 - Sara: But i meant that you should be backed up
8/15/19, 00:12 - Sara: What do you want to do, Kamil?
8/15/19, 00:12 - Sara: I do not want to leave you alone
8/15/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was practicing guitar, now I'll probably go to sleep
8/15/19, 00:13 - Sara: Nice about the guitar ♥
8/15/19, 00:13 - Sara: I meant in general
8/15/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
8/15/19, 00:13 - Sara: Can I be there?
8/15/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably
8/15/19, 00:16 - Sara: Probably?
8/15/19, 00:16 - Sara: You confuse me
8/15/19, 00:18 - Sara: 😔
8/15/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I feel completely lost
8/15/19, 00:19 - Sara: Let me help you
8/15/19, 00:19 - Sara: At least to forget everything for a while
8/15/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: How?
8/15/19, 00:20 - Sara: We can talk, play, watch a series or a film, discuss about interesting topics
8/15/19, 00:24 - Sara: Up to you, Kamil
8/15/19, 00:24 - Sara: You decide how to deal with everhthing
8/15/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can try
8/15/19, 00:26 - Sara: Nice 🤗
8/15/19, 00:41 - Sara: Good night
8/15/19, 01:51 - Sara: -sending hug-
8/16/19, 01:59 - Sara: How are you?
8/16/19, 02:58 - Sara: I should be sleeping but I need to comment this now after thinking about it these days. In this way, I can let you think as well.
8/16/19, 02:59 - Sara: I’m tired of noticing you don’t want anything with me; no letting love happen again, no intention of maintaining a friendship, no intention of changing your inner situation, not even talking to me or asking for help. Nothing. This is heart-breaking, and also it is heart-breaking that you really doubt  if you really loved me. Am I a fool for still having feelings towards you? When I think about our moments or see our photos, was all that happiness of yours fake? For me it was like in heaven, but maybe it was a lie. I’m afraid.
8/16/19, 03:00 - Sara: Maybe I was a bitch for what i did but i’m human, making my mistakes and trying to find my way. However, that is not an excuse for you treating me like shit, with passivity.  Are you Kamil? Do I know you now? I don’t recognize you anymore. Can I find him soon if all his problems disappear or i will never see him again because now he hates me?
8/16/19, 03:03 - Sara: Perhaps what I explained some days ago was complex, weird. I’m frightened you misunderstood me for talking in a chaotic mannsr. Am I trying to change you and l want you to be something you are not? No.  I just want to be there, no matter how, although you don’t let me. Maybe in my hippie way, but I want to give my caring and my love. Cannot I be given an opportunity in any sphere?
8/16/19, 03:04 - Sara: I understand that you think i’m a immature whore who does not know what she knows. But, do you? At least I try to fight for what I want to keep in my life and for my well-being. If you know what you need, just tell me. “Sara, stay”, “Sara, go”. “Sara, i’m not interested in you anymore”. “Sara, you give me anxiety”. Easy. I will accept it. I want you to be okay.
8/16/19, 03:05 - Sara: So yes. I offered you my hand once, twice, three times. I did my best for showing that i believe in second chances and i want to have you in my life (at least with the polish boy I met before) and giving you support. This is up to you now. My job here is done.
8/16/19, 03:05 - Sara: I’m also good in describing my mood with songs. This might help.  https://youtu.be/en2D_5TzXCA
8/16/19, 03:06 - Sara: If you talk to me in hours,  weeks, months, years... i’ll be so pleasant to help you and to be part of your life and your happiness. But now I feel horrible for spending time in someone who prefers me far away or spitting me on my face, and for not receiving what I give.
8/16/19, 03:07 - Sara: Any question will be answered and every message will be replied if you need it
8/16/19, 03:09 - Sara: Bye Kamil. Hope to see/know about you soon and that your problema find a solution. Good luck with your exam and your thesis. I love you.
8/16/19, 12:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't lie, our time together in Ghent was the happiest that I ever had, maybe that's why it hurts so much now, that I'm at my lowest. I don't know if you should still have feelings towards me, I feel like I'm just holding you back from experimenting and discovering yourself and I don't want to do that, to be just a burden
8/16/19, 12:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe for you a few days is enough to get better, for me, I don't know, I don't feel any better and I don't know what to do about it
8/16/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meq0zmOb8EA
8/16/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is the song that describes what I've been feeling for some time now
8/16/19, 12:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: My problem started even before the break up, I told you that I was feeling like the end was approaching for us, and everything else that's happening certainly doesn't help
8/16/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to hold you back, I never wanted to do that which is why it's probably better for you to move on, I don't blame you for breaking up, you just did what's best for you in the long term
8/16/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for everything, I really wanted this, us, to work but in the end I don't know if it's possible
8/16/19, 13:13 - Sara: You won’t hold me back, I don’t want to lose you in my life. No matter what we are.
8/16/19, 13:14 - Sara: Just let me help you
8/16/19, 13:15 - Sara: We are/were very bad individually. And we need to be strong for having a long distance relationship.
8/16/19, 13:16 - Sara: I always think that if we had done the trip in august, any of this would not have happened. If we were in Ghent or in any place living together, this would not have happened. And that is bullshit.
8/16/19, 13:19 - Sara: I told you I will treat you the same (or even better?) if we still talk. I just need to know who I am. I need to take everything easy.
8/16/19, 13:21 - Sara: I don’t to close any door to you. The opposite. I don’t close any possibility with anybody.
8/16/19, 13:22 - Sara: Why do you suffer if I’m here? Why do you make me thing that you don’t... love me?
8/16/19, 13:24 - Sara: I prefer you seeing me a strong, confident Sara as a whatever than a confused and a weak Sara as a couple
8/16/19, 13:26 - Sara: I need to know who I am, but future will say
8/16/19, 13:26 - Sara: I am still wanting to talk to you, to kiss you, yo hug you, to visit you anywhere. Because you are worth it.
8/16/19, 13:26 - Sara: Only a couple can do that?
8/16/19, 13:27 - Sara: *think
8/16/19, 13:28 - Sara: That’s why I say to keep in touch, but that is about two. Not only me.
8/16/19, 13:29 - Sara: What do you think?
8/16/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps yes, at this point it will be difficult for me to separate it which is why I'm afraid of it
8/16/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I told you lately, we can try to do something together
8/16/19, 13:30 - Sara: Tell me more
8/16/19, 13:30 - Sara: Like playing and that stuff?
8/16/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/16/19, 13:31 - Sara: We can
8/16/19, 13:32 - Sara: But you should have iniciative
8/16/19, 13:32 - Sara: I do not want to push you
8/16/19, 13:33 - Sara: Why are we doing things more complex?
8/16/19, 13:37 - Sara: Show me that you want
8/16/19, 13:40 - Sara: At least let me you to forget for a while of this shitty world, please
8/16/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, we can try, I'm not making any promises, I really hope this works out
8/16/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's difficult for me to be more cheerful when nothing seems to work in my life
8/16/19, 13:42 - Sara: I don’t like promises, I told you ;p actions speak louder than words
8/16/19, 13:43 - Sara: How is it?
8/16/19, 13:43 - Sara: It will ;)
8/16/19, 13:48 - Sara: Tell me, any news?
8/16/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at the moment, maybe next week
8/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: Nice 😊
8/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: Me too, i have my medical appointment on Monday
8/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: Do you feel like soing something (later)?
8/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: Or you have plans?
8/16/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: For this evening I do, maybe next day
8/16/19, 13:56 - Sara: Great! Are you meeting your friends?
8/16/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that
8/16/19, 14:00 - Sara: Well, it is the beginning! Nice 🤗
8/16/19, 14:01 - Sara: Kamil, can I tell you something?
8/16/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Go ahead
8/16/19, 14:01 - Sara: Have you considered going to a psychologist?
8/16/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/16/19, 14:01 - Sara: You are not okay
8/16/19, 14:02 - Sara: I considered it as well
8/16/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need a friend, not a professional
8/16/19, 14:02 - Sara: Why do you think that?
8/16/19, 14:03 - Sara: You have me
8/16/19, 14:03 - Sara: Sometimes a friend does not know how our mind works
8/16/19, 14:05 - Sara: And even having my support you are not okay
8/16/19, 14:05 - Sara: (Maybe i’m doing damage?)
8/16/19, 14:06 - Sara: It is not about being crazy or something like that, but knowing what it happening in your head
8/16/19, 14:06 - Sara: Well, it was a suggestion
8/16/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know what it is about, but I don't want it
8/16/19, 14:07 - Sara: Okay
8/16/19, 14:07 - Sara: What can a friend do?
8/16/19, 14:09 - Sara: What do you need from them?
8/16/19, 14:15 - Sara: Well, i’m here if you need something
8/16/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure, in Ghent I was quite happy so I guess just being there is enough maybe?
8/16/19, 14:17 - Sara: Imagine going there soon ♥ it is not a lie that we have direct flights there
8/16/19, 14:17 - Sara: But now?
8/16/19, 14:39 - Sara: Another question: is the break up was makes you sad? The thesis and the future? Everything?
8/16/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Loneliness
8/16/19, 15:34 - Sara: Tell me more
8/16/19, 16:23 - Sara: Btw, I want to say that thanks for everything. It was a blessing meeting you and seeing your beauty face to face and in the distance. You have given me a light that I have never found. In Ghent or wherever, I want to support you through the pass of years. You are not alone. I love you a lot, no matter how we are💕
8/16/19, 16:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/16/19, 19:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/16/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you overestimate me a lot but thanks anyway, if you need help, I will help you too
8/16/19, 19:44 - Sara: I do not overestimate you. You let me know you.
8/16/19, 19:44 - Sara: It was beautiful all that process of you becoming happier and happier
8/16/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shame that only temporarily
8/16/19, 19:46 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/16/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not happy anymore
8/16/19, 19:46 - Sara: You can be happy
8/16/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Different than before Erasmus, but not at all happier
8/16/19, 19:47 - Sara: What I did to make you happy?
8/16/19, 19:47 - Sara: Do you really need someone to find happiness?
8/16/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: It wasn't just you
8/16/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: The whole leaving on my own, in a new place
8/16/19, 19:48 - Sara: What was it then?
8/16/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply enjoying life
8/16/19, 19:48 - Sara: You can have this
8/16/19, 19:48 - Sara: Different, of course. But it is about time.
8/16/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: At some point, but I have no clue when
8/16/19, 19:49 - Sara: But at least the opportunity is there
8/16/19, 19:50 - Sara: We are so impatient
8/16/19, 19:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I waited my whole life, I don't think I'm impatient, just stupid
8/16/19, 19:51 - Sara: Why stupid?
8/16/19, 19:51 - Sara: Waiting for what? Independence?
8/16/19, 19:57 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/16/19, 20:02 - Sara: Maybe it is about accepting that Erasmus finished, but the same time analysing it and trying to make it happen similarly in your future
8/16/19, 20:03 - Sara: Instead of dreaming about the past, trie to change the present and adapt it to the current you
8/16/19, 20:04 - Sara: If I’m honest, all this shit that happened to me was probably because of facing a reality afted one year, having the life I wanted there. I thought everything was stables and solved but... no
8/16/19, 20:04 - Sara: Stable*
8/16/19, 20:05 - Sara: Perhaps time helps and establishing the “now” and the “later”
8/16/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's what I wanted to do but then I realized that I have nothing here
8/16/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it didn't go so well...
8/16/19, 20:06 - Sara: No friends? No activities to do? No things to learn?
8/16/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Friends left, I guess I can do something but doing that alone is not so great, things to learn of course, as always but that does not necessarily make me feel better
8/16/19, 20:07 - Sara: Left not so far right?
8/16/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite far
8/16/19, 20:08 - Sara: Zero friends in Lodz?
8/16/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: My best friend is still there for like a month and then I think nothing
8/16/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Uni ends and there is not much reason to stay there
8/16/19, 20:09 - Sara: Meet him as much as possible and tell him about your situation
8/16/19, 20:10 - Sara: Think about moving out, then. But really.
8/16/19, 20:10 - Sara: Be proactive, Kamil.
8/16/19, 20:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's rather difficult at the moment considering I have to wait for everything
8/16/19, 20:11 - Sara: Thesis? One week, not a lot
8/16/19, 20:11 - Sara: Internships start in September/october
8/16/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still have an exam in september and some time after that the defense
8/16/19, 20:12 - Sara: You can focus on that
8/16/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe in October but I have no money so it's not really possible anyway
8/16/19, 20:13 - Sara: Not your parents?
8/16/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to ask them for more
8/16/19, 20:13 - Sara: But... they should help you
8/16/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I have a place in their house so that's something
8/16/19, 20:14 - Sara: Have you commented them your situation?
8/16/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: For my mother it would be best if I just stayed where I am or somewhere close to it
8/16/19, 20:15 - Sara: And your father?
8/16/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if he cares or not, every time I mention how I dislike Lodz he gets annoyed
8/16/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And they never cared much for anything outside of uni or job
8/16/19, 20:18 - Sara: Refered to you, you mean?
8/16/19, 20:19 - Sara: Like they only care about your studies and you working?
8/16/19, 20:21 - Sara: And have you searched for a job?
8/16/19, 20:23 - Sara: This message was deleted
8/16/19, 20:24 - Sara: Well, i should not push you with this. You know the situation than me, but keeping a negative actitude will make things worse
8/16/19, 20:29 - Sara: This message was deleted
8/16/19, 20:30 - Sara: What do you want from me? That is a question i have in mind
8/16/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know to be honest
8/16/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can continue with the plan and just do something together from time to time
8/16/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once I at least solve the problems with uni maybe I'll feel better and I will be able to search for something
8/16/19, 20:42 - Sara: Up to you
8/16/19, 20:42 - Sara: You decide. I give you space.
8/16/19, 20:42 - Sara: For me it is okay
8/16/19, 20:43 - Sara: But idk, that makes me sad
8/16/19, 21:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why sad?
8/16/19, 21:17 - Sara: 1) you are sad
8/16/19, 21:17 - Sara: 2) distance
8/16/19, 21:18 - Sara: 3) i still want to be with you in anyway but i doubt about you
8/16/19, 21:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once you break something you can put it back together but it's not going to be the same, it will always have cracks
8/16/19, 21:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can try, maybe we can figure something out
8/16/19, 21:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something new, something old, maybe something in between
8/16/19, 23:04 - Sara: But what exactly?
8/16/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I knew
8/16/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: As you said before, just let it happen
8/16/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what this "it" will be
8/16/19, 23:06 - Sara: What do you think (about me) now?
8/16/19, 23:06 - Sara: Yes of course
8/16/19, 23:06 - Sara: But like... idk if you feel like talking with me or idk
8/16/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know that either so if you figure it out, tell me
8/16/19, 23:10 - Sara: Like what i think about you? I jave that quite clear
8/16/19, 23:13 - Sara: So idk
8/16/19, 23:13 - Sara: You should be clear as well
8/16/19, 23:13 - Sara: Don’t hurt me
8/16/19, 23:15 - Sara: I really love  you  and my feelings has not disappeared
8/16/19, 23:16 - Sara: But idk, your behaviour is essential i think
8/16/19, 23:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: You hurt me, it takes time to get better
8/16/19, 23:17 - Sara: Why?
8/16/19, 23:17 - Sara: What did I do?
8/16/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Break up
8/16/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: In a very difficult moment
8/16/19, 23:18 - Sara: Cannot be there now as a friend, couple or whatever?
8/16/19, 23:18 - Sara: It was true, but i exploded
8/16/19, 23:18 - Sara: And maybe i made no good
8/16/19, 23:19 - Sara: But both of us were bad
8/16/19, 23:19 - Sara: Sorry 😔
8/16/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that was a good reason?
8/16/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can, I just need some time
8/16/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm willing to try
8/16/19, 23:20 - Sara: Why are you like that?
8/16/19, 23:21 - Sara: Me being too weak to help me and to help you
8/16/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to help, I really did
8/16/19, 23:21 - Sara: Me too
8/16/19, 23:22 - Sara: But you were... i don’t know
8/16/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if splitting up at the moment we needed each other the most  was a good idea
8/16/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it doesn't matter anymore
8/16/19, 23:22 - Sara: Yes it matter, Kamil
8/16/19, 23:23 - Sara: Did I change since then?
8/16/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It happened, I will get over it
8/16/19, 23:23 - Sara: Fuck Kamil
8/16/19, 23:23 - Sara: I was fucking bad as well
8/16/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I wanted to be there for you
8/16/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: More than anything else
8/16/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you ran away
8/16/19, 23:24 - Sara: And i told you i did not want to make ypu more harm
8/16/19, 23:24 - Sara: Add my shit to yours?
8/16/19, 23:24 - Sara: Not being able of helping each other?
8/16/19, 23:24 - Sara: Feel frusrated for distance?
8/16/19, 23:25 - Sara: I wanted you so bad by my side
8/16/19, 23:25 - Sara: But now i ask cor help
8/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: I needed the break up for starting to realise who i was and to be betted
8/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: But yes, Sara is the evil ons
8/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: One*
8/16/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't say that
8/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: I feel like the guilty
8/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: You did
8/16/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand and I don't blame you, really
8/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Does it hurt? Yes
8/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do I blame you? No
8/16/19, 23:27 - Sara: You did
8/16/19, 23:27 - Sara: You did
8/16/19, 23:27 - Sara: You did
8/16/19, 23:28 - Sara: If i were there in Poland everything would be easier
8/16/19, 23:28 - Sara: But i’m not fucking there
8/16/19, 23:28 - Sara: And i feel that i have not given everything for the relation
8/16/19, 23:29 - Sara: Maybe i’m not ready now, but in ghe future i will
8/16/19, 23:29 - Sara: Idk Kamil
8/16/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should be happy about that 😋
8/16/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fucking Poland
8/16/19, 23:29 - Sara: I don’t hate you
8/16/19, 23:29 - Sara: Not being there with you?
8/16/19, 23:30 - Sara: Not being able to help one of my important person in my life?
8/16/19, 23:31 - Sara: It is frustration what i feel
8/16/19, 23:31 - Sara: For what i treated
8/16/19, 23:31 - Sara: But now it is the best momento for knowing myself
8/16/19, 23:31 - Sara: I’m getting stronger, more self-confidence idk
8/16/19, 23:32 - Sara: I’m solving my problems finally
8/16/19, 23:33 - Sara: But i have these inconvenience
8/16/19, 23:36 - Sara: Be sincere with me
8/16/19, 23:37 - Sara: I think you hide me a lot
8/16/19, 23:37 - Sara: That i’m not the person you used to see
8/16/19, 23:37 - Sara: But at least i want to know if
8/16/19, 23:37 - Sara: It*
8/16/19, 23:37 - Sara: And decide if this effort is worth
8/16/19, 23:38 - Sara: Because i can think one thing and you other
8/16/19, 23:39 - Sara: Again, your choice
8/16/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I need time to figure it out
8/16/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is why I want to try to do something together
8/16/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it will help to find some answers
8/16/19, 23:41 - Sara: Tell me
8/16/19, 23:41 - Sara: To you? Okay
8/16/19, 23:41 - Sara: For me it is okay
8/16/19, 23:47 - Sara: But i need you iniciative
8/16/19, 23:47 - Sara: The one that you want
8/16/19, 23:48 - Sara: But i feel i’m doing it alone
8/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: Okayv
8/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: ?
8/16/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I'm a little bit busy
8/16/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: But okay, for me it's fine, I think
8/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: It is okay
8/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/16/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll tell you later, ok?
8/16/19, 23:56 - Sara: Of course!
8/17/19, 02:58 - Sara: Kamil, can you forgive me?
8/17/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: At 3a.m.? Girl, is sleeping not a thing in Spain?
8/17/19, 13:27 - Sara: I don’t tell you at what time I went to sleep then... xd
8/17/19, 13:28 - Sara: I went out yesterday for a bit
8/17/19, 13:36 - Sara: But if that is the first thing you say to me... uf
8/17/19, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you think you did anything you need forgiveness for?
8/17/19, 13:37 - Sara: Mmmmm yes
8/17/19, 13:38 - Sara: Too many things
8/17/19, 13:44 - Sara: What did you do yesterday?
8/17/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I tried going out with my brother but it didn't go very well
8/17/19, 13:46 - Sara: Why? What happened?
8/17/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, just difficult to get along with his friends
8/17/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: We wanted to play pool
8/17/19, 13:46 - Sara: Different personality?
8/17/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the place was closed for some reason
8/17/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: 5 years difference, completely different interests
8/17/19, 13:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was an experiment, I guess
8/17/19, 13:47 - Sara: And?
8/17/19, 13:47 - Sara: Yes, it is always good trying
8/17/19, 13:47 - Sara: Depending
8/17/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: We went to some other bar but it was crappy
8/17/19, 13:48 - Sara: Why crappy?
8/17/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Poor beer (thanks Belgium), place itself was rather unremarkable, I didn't really have anybody to talk to, I tried but I failed
8/17/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you? What did you do?
8/17/19, 13:50 - Sara: Next time it will be better
8/17/19, 13:50 - Sara: Don’t think it is always going to be like that
8/17/19, 13:50 - Sara: My friends came to my house, we talked and we play some board games
8/17/19, 13:51 - Sara: And they wanted to have fresh air, so i convinced my parents as well to go to the city centre to have a lemon ice drink and talk
8/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: I’m afraid because i almost fell and i stepped with my sick leg
8/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: But yep, i went to sleep so late
8/17/19, 13:54 - Sara: And how are you now?
8/17/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same as before, first attempt at changing that failed
8/17/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next try next week
8/17/19, 13:55 - Sara: They only go out once?
8/17/19, 13:56 - Sara: Or people there in general?
8/17/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if I can get along with them
8/17/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next week I'm meeting my friend from uni so that should be better
8/17/19, 13:57 - Sara: You should see that
8/17/19, 13:58 - Sara: Maybe first times are difficult, weird
8/17/19, 13:58 - Sara: As everything 👀😂
8/17/19, 13:58 - Sara: Probably yes, trust is already there
8/17/19, 13:59 - Sara: But don’t lose faith
8/17/19, 13:59 - Sara: How do you feel?
8/17/19, 14:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tired, lonely, sad, bored
8/17/19, 14:00 - Sara: Why all of that?
8/17/19, 14:00 - Sara: Probably i’ll stay at home today (i’m afraid for the knee 😭), if you wsnt to play
8/17/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, today is fine
8/17/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow I have to attend baptism of my cousin's child...
8/17/19, 14:01 - Sara: Nice
8/17/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just perfect...
8/17/19, 14:01 - Sara: Ugh, sorry man
8/17/19, 14:02 - Sara: Suit day 🤗
8/17/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Church day 🤢
8/17/19, 14:02 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 14:02 - Sara: Nah, i hope not spending so much time
8/17/19, 14:03 - Sara: Why are you tired?
8/17/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, not just physically but mentally, I guess
8/17/19, 14:05 - Sara: Tell me more, why physically?
8/17/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I returned late, that's pretty simple
8/17/19, 14:06 - Sara: Ay
8/17/19, 14:06 - Sara: Mentally* xd
8/17/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I went on Erasmus to change something and I did but I was always afraid that after it ends everything will return to the way it was before
8/17/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it did
8/17/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm trying to change something but it's difficult and quite draining
8/17/19, 14:08 - Sara: Do you think you are the same?
8/17/19, 14:08 - Sara: What exactly?
8/17/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not the same but the situation is
8/17/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe even worse considering most of my friends left
8/17/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And on top of that all the problems with uni
8/17/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Before at least I never had problems with uni
8/17/19, 14:10 - Sara: These will be solved, i’m sure
8/17/19, 14:10 - Sara: At least that is something and you are closer of what you want to do or be
8/17/19, 14:11 - Sara: You have returned 10 days ago, i understand that emptiness
8/17/19, 14:12 - Sara: Time solves problems as well
8/17/19, 14:12 - Sara: Actitude also
8/17/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: So very spanglish :)
8/17/19, 14:14 - Sara: 😂
8/17/19, 14:14 - Sara: Attitude xd
8/17/19, 14:15 - Sara: Did you see the photos?
8/17/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/17/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a lot of them
8/17/19, 14:15 - Sara: Yes 😁
8/17/19, 14:18 - Sara: And that is good
8/17/19, 14:21 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/17/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much at the moment
8/17/19, 15:20 - Sara: What should i do?
8/17/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
8/17/19, 15:23 - Sara: With you
8/17/19, 15:23 - Sara: How do you want me to act
8/17/19, 15:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
8/17/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can we just try to do something and see how it works out?
8/17/19, 15:24 - Sara: Yes, of courae
8/17/19, 15:24 - Sara: As we mentioned
8/17/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, is the knee alright? Does it hurt or something?
8/17/19, 15:40 - Sara: I think so
8/17/19, 15:40 - Sara: Well, i told you i put it by accident on the floor when i almost fell and i’m worried
8/17/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, that's why I'm asking
8/17/19, 15:40 - Sara: It is hurting more than expecting, but that is probably because i was going out until 4
8/17/19, 15:41 - Sara: I should rest today
8/17/19, 15:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe not the most responsible but I understand that staying at home is hard
8/17/19, 15:41 - Sara: But i’m moving it better than one week ago, so that is quite nice
8/17/19, 15:41 - Sara: 😢
8/17/19, 15:42 - Sara: Understandable
8/17/19, 15:42 - Sara: Maybe it is mental and i’m gettig obsessed xd
8/17/19, 15:43 - Sara: Thanks for asking
8/17/19, 15:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have a visit on Monday, right?
8/17/19, 15:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope everything will be all right
8/17/19, 15:53 - Sara: Yes ♥
8/17/19, 15:53 - Sara: I’m so excited for that, really
8/17/19, 15:54 - Sara: I wish i can do rehab and recover faster
8/17/19, 15:54 - Sara: Or even walk little by little
8/17/19, 17:56 - Sara: I’m free now, if you feel like doimg something
8/17/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm studying a bit, is later also fine for you?
8/17/19, 18:24 - Sara: I don’t know, i’ll have visit probably
8/17/19, 18:24 - Sara: Study hard then 💪 😊
8/17/19, 18:31 - Sara: Tell me when you are free and i tell you
8/17/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also apparently have a family party at home...
8/17/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I had no clue, just great...
8/17/19, 18:35 - Sara: And you are like
8/17/19, 18:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 18:35 - Sara: Great?
8/17/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at all
8/17/19, 18:35 - Sara: Well, i think the visit will be partially late
8/17/19, 18:35 - Sara: We will see
8/17/19, 18:36 - Sara: Any birthday?
8/17/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something similar
8/17/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure how is that called in English
8/17/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not even sure if it's celebrated anywhere else
8/17/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nameday or something
8/17/19, 18:37 - Sara: Like saint’s day?
8/17/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Interestingly my parents don't celebrate birthday typically
8/17/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of strange
8/17/19, 18:38 - Sara: Yep
8/17/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never really understood that
8/17/19, 18:38 - Sara: Theirs you mean?
8/17/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why this nameday whatever and not the birthday
8/17/19, 18:38 - Sara: More important maybe?
8/17/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't make much sense to me
8/17/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I suppose it's the same as birthday I guess, just on different date
8/17/19, 18:39 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 18:40 - Sara: How do you determine that day?
8/17/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
8/17/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's in the calendar, I think
8/17/19, 18:41 - Sara: Mmmm yep, it is like your saint day
8/17/19, 18:41 - Sara: I don’t have then, or i have to google it xD
8/17/19, 18:41 - Sara: When is it yours?
8/17/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know actually, I never celebrated it
8/17/19, 18:42 - Sara: You would not celebrate even your birthday
8/17/19, 18:42 - Sara: Neither you like presents?
8/17/19, 18:48 - Sara: Or it is about people being annoying with you? I understand that
8/17/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes, you've already seen that
8/17/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't get presents, sometimes cash
8/17/19, 19:08 - Sara: But do you like them anyway?
8/17/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I simply don't care enough to celebrate my birthday
8/17/19, 19:08 - Sara: What do you like to celebrate?
8/17/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Birthdays of other people are fine, anything really
8/17/19, 19:10 - Sara: Why don’t you care about you?
8/17/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why should I celebrate getting old
8/17/19, 19:10 - Sara: Not only celebrating birthdays
8/17/19, 19:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or celebrate another year in which I haven't done anything meaningful
8/17/19, 19:11 - Sara: Why are you so harsh with yourself?
8/17/19, 19:11 - Sara: I’m sure even the smallest thing you do is meaningful
8/17/19, 19:14 - Sara: :/
8/17/19, 19:17 - Sara: Maybe i’m the harsh one but i want to help
8/17/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I spent significant time trying to convince you to be less harsh to yourself, so you better not be 😉
8/17/19, 19:41 - Sara: Well
8/17/19, 19:41 - Sara: I meant me being harsh with you
8/17/19, 19:43 - Sara: In my case maaaany people told me that, that i’m too perfectionist and i do self-sabotage
8/17/19, 19:44 - Sara: But althogh they used to say it to me, i did realize
8/17/19, 19:44 - Sara: It is just like
8/17/19, 19:44 - Sara: Am i happy doing this to myself?
8/17/19, 19:45 - Sara: Are you happy, Kamil?
8/17/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: To be perfectionist I would have to have something to perfect
8/17/19, 19:59 - Sara: You don’t have it?
8/17/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I haven't achieved anything significant, maybe something
8/17/19, 20:00 - Sara: The one with great marks in engineering who went on erasmus
8/17/19, 20:00 - Sara: Nothing achieved
8/17/19, 20:00 - Sara: And that is the minimum
8/17/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Great marks in Poland
8/17/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not exactly what I would consider an achievement
8/17/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Going on Erasmus is also not really an achievement
8/17/19, 20:01 - Sara: And great average
8/17/19, 20:01 - Sara: Not really? And living there in another language and dealing with a different sociefy and education system?
8/17/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should get a golden medal for managing to stay alive
8/17/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, not that different
8/17/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Europe it's never that different
8/17/19, 20:03 - Sara: Mmmm... yes?
8/17/19, 20:03 - Sara: For me it was different
8/17/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it was different because I was on my own and I lived in the city but I don't know if the new country itself was that important
8/17/19, 20:04 - Sara: That is up to you
8/17/19, 20:04 - Sara: But yep
8/17/19, 20:04 - Sara: Not everybody can say that
8/17/19, 20:05 - Sara: Or speak english that nicd
8/17/19, 20:05 - Sara: Nice
8/17/19, 20:05 - Sara: You cannor run away
8/17/19, 20:05 - Sara: Value your actions and yourself
8/17/19, 20:05 - Sara: You told me the same
8/17/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you actually achieved something
8/17/19, 20:06 - Sara: Music?
8/17/19, 20:06 - Sara: I didn’t, i’m not famous 😂
8/17/19, 20:06 - Sara: Joking, it is a hobby
8/17/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Music, great marks on a country scale
8/17/19, 20:07 - Sara: And we are nothing
8/17/19, 20:07 - Sara: You have better marks (!!!)
8/17/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Inspiring people also
8/17/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
8/17/19, 20:08 - Sara: I cannot control that, but it is actually beautiful
8/17/19, 20:08 - Sara: Time and effort, basically
8/17/19, 20:08 - Sara: And money if talking about music
8/17/19, 20:08 - Sara: It is not magic
8/17/19, 20:10 - Sara: And yep
8/17/19, 20:10 - Sara: And i’m still the same loser 😂
8/17/19, 20:10 - Sara: I mean... things can be better, i know
8/17/19, 20:10 - Sara: Tomorrow will be better than yesterday
8/17/19, 20:11 - Sara: And I (we) are young to change what we want
8/17/19, 20:16 - Sara: Maybe i’m too optimistic or innocent idk
8/17/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 20:21 - Sara: If you knew...
8/17/19, 20:21 - Sara: You don’t imagine 🙁
8/17/19, 20:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 20:30 - Sara: https://youtu.be/LmUoNNPsOHQ
8/17/19, 20:30 - Sara: I like what he says, maybe you too
8/17/19, 20:43 - Sara: Btw, good luck with the imieniny
8/17/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehhh, fucking children...
8/17/19, 20:56 - Sara: Children?
8/17/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Family visits, they bring their children
8/17/19, 20:57 - Sara: You can deal that
8/17/19, 20:57 - Sara: :3
8/17/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 21:02 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/17/19, 23:56 - Sara: Kamil, did you watch WWE?
8/18/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I watched a few years ago
8/18/19, 00:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/18/19, 00:28 - Sara: How is it going?
8/18/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everyone is gone and I was practicing on the electric guitar
8/18/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of more satisfying than acoustic
8/18/19, 00:29 - Sara: Ohhhhh
8/18/19, 00:29 - Sara: Nice
8/18/19, 00:29 - Sara: Do you notice the differences?
8/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot
8/18/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's much easier on electric
8/18/19, 00:30 - Sara: Really? You told me the opposite
8/18/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure I always said that electric is much easier
8/18/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's better to learn on acoustic because if you do you will manage on electric too
8/18/19, 00:31 - Sara: Aaaah true true
8/18/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: The other way around I'm not so sure
8/18/19, 00:31 - Sara: And how was the party?
8/18/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some uncle and aunts visited, they talked, ate, drank a bit and then left
8/18/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Boring
8/18/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehh, old people...
8/18/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
8/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: Like you
8/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: Ugh 😑

8/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: I really like this face
8/18/19, 00:33 - Sara: It is so you
8/18/19, 00:34 - Sara: Not tired?
8/18/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
8/18/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow the baptism...
8/18/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fortunately it shouldn't take very long
8/18/19, 00:34 - Sara: At what time?
8/18/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: So on the evening I'll be free
8/18/19, 00:35 - Sara: Nice
8/18/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: At 13 in the church
8/18/19, 00:35 - Sara: I won’t go out neither

8/18/19, 00:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/18/19, 00:36 - Sara: When was the last time you went to a church?
8/18/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't remember
8/18/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe for some funeral or a wedding
8/18/19, 00:41 - Sara: Maybe only visiting it :p
8/18/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, you need to be more specific
8/18/19, 00:42 - Sara: Angels should be there more often...
8/18/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the church, actually fairly often in the last months
8/18/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the mass, no clue
8/18/19, 00:42 - Sara: #boring

8/18/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Enough for the moment
8/18/19, 00:55 - Sara: How much time have you been playing?

8/18/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: My fingers are not in the shape for playing yet
8/18/19, 00:56 - Sara: Quite nice

8/18/19, 02:01 - Sara: Are you studying Spanish now?
8/18/19, 02:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's something I've seen earlier and I forgot to ask
8/18/19, 02:02 - Sara: Hahahha yes, we have like a lot of fixed expressions

8/18/19, 02:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes it was slightly confusing
8/18/19, 02:07 - Sara: I have even problems with that
8/18/19, 02:07 - Sara: In the centre of Spain we mix indirect and direct pronouns sometimes
8/18/19, 02:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, fully is probably an overstatement
8/18/19, 02:07 - Sara: Almost
8/18/19, 02:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow I'll take a look at indirect
8/18/19, 02:08 - Sara: Right?

8/18/19, 23:39 - Sara: Left one?
8/18/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Left one from playing that song
8/18/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Right one for no reason for the last two weeks
8/18/19, 23:40 - Sara: Really? What have you been doing?
8/18/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, maybe some of the exercises put too much stress on it
8/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: Probably
8/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: Part of my hand hurted me because of the push ups
8/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: So probably is that
8/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: How are you?
8/18/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok-ish, tomorrow is an important day

8/18/19, 23:45 - Sara: I’m not in the mood then
8/18/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why are you watching it then?
8/18/19, 23:46 - Sara: Nothing else to do
8/18/19, 23:46 - Sara: Maybe makes me more sad 😂
8/18/19, 23:53 - Sara: But yes, i’ll watch it
8/18/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Such a good daughter
8/18/19, 23:54 - Sara: Why?
8/18/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: You watch it with your parents even though you've already seen it

8/18/19, 23:56 - Sara: Todo
8/18/19, 23:56 - Sara: 😌
8/18/19, 23:57 - Sara: Maybe I have to be more direct 😂
8/19/19, 00:00 - Sara: Well, maybe I can explain it in another moment. It is not the best time now.
8/19/19, 00:01 - Sara: Good night, Kamil
8/19/19, 00:01 - Sara: Good luck tomorrow

8/19/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like what?
8/19/19, 00:04 - Sara: Cold
8/19/19, 00:06 - Sara: I don’t know how to behave with you
8/19/19, 00:07 - Sara: It is true also that you don’t owe me anything
8/19/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I misunderstood something, I cannot read minds, sadly
8/19/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm tired, I feel a bit better but still poorly so I'm not very enthusiastic lately, sorry
8/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: Well
8/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: I don’t know
8/19/19, 00:09 - Sara: Too many things to say but...meh
8/19/19, 00:09 - Sara: I said i was sad, but again
8/19/19, 00:09 - Sara: .
8/19/19, 00:12 - Sara: Sorry, it is just... I’m having weird days related to all of this
8/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: Probably I have to stop trying and move on, although i do not want that
8/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what would you like to achieve?
8/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have you figured that out?
8/19/19, 00:14 - Sara: Achieve? In what sense?
8/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: I know it for a long time, i think
8/19/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that is?
8/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: I thought you know it
8/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lately you've been changing your mind quite a lot
8/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: So maybe I did at one point
8/19/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, not so sure
8/19/19, 00:18 - Sara: Ugh
8/19/19, 00:18 - Sara: Why is this so hard
8/19/19, 00:19 - Sara: I’m ridiculous
8/19/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: You told you broke up with me because of your and mine problems, mine are not solved, what about yours?
8/19/19, 00:20 - Sara: The only thing i have to solve now is my relation with you
8/19/19, 00:21 - Sara: And sometimes i fight for a person who does not care about me and that:  sucks
8/19/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: So again, what is your perfect situation here?
8/19/19, 00:22 - Sara: Here?
8/19/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Here
8/19/19, 00:22 - Sara: Good question
8/19/19, 00:22 - Sara: Too embarrassed to answer it 😂
8/19/19, 00:25 - Sara: I’m afraid of rejection hahahahhahahahaha
8/19/19, 00:28 - Sara: And afraid of being ignored 😂😂😂😂
8/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: It is weird, nop
8/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: What do you want?
8/19/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked you first
8/19/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I still have no clue tbh
8/19/19, 00:30 - Sara: So i won’t answer, think first
8/19/19, 00:30 - Sara: I don’t want to interfere
8/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: But again, i thought you knew it
8/19/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I told you that after all that happened I'm not so sure anymore
8/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: I know
8/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: And again
8/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: I’m hurt
8/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Interfere with what?
8/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: My opinion with yours
8/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: So am I
8/19/19, 00:33 - Sara: Are you going to judge me forever?
8/19/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I won't , I'm trying to get an honest answer from you
8/19/19, 00:33 - Sara: To what?
8/19/19, 00:34 - Sara: To this?
8/19/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/19/19, 00:34 - Sara: Why do you want it?
8/19/19, 00:34 - Sara: It is useless
8/19/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/19/19, 00:35 - Sara: Senseless
8/19/19, 00:36 - Sara: Senseless conclusion
8/19/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
8/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: I feel defendless saying if
8/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: It
8/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: Even thinking it
8/19/19, 00:38 - Sara: Go to sleep, maybe i’m too sensitive
8/19/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to push you, tell me when (or if) you feel like
8/19/19, 00:39 - Sara: Is it important?
8/19/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: What you want? Yes
8/19/19, 00:40 - Sara: You knowing what i was feeling about you, you treated my quite shitty
8/19/19, 00:41 - Sara: I suposed that you wanted to keep distance
8/19/19, 00:42 - Sara: And yes, i don’t ignore that i have feelings for you
8/19/19, 00:42 - Sara: But i feel i’m just forcing things
8/19/19, 00:43 - Sara: I want to be okay with you
8/19/19, 00:43 - Sara: I want to establish something good for both of us
8/19/19, 00:45 - Sara: But I don’t feel you care about me anymore, and you told me you doubt if you loved me. It is clear.
8/19/19, 00:45 - Sara: It is just.. i don’t know what is happening, and i feel it like a storm
8/19/19, 00:45 - Sara: So yes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8/19/19, 00:46 - Sara: Nothing nee

8/19/19, 00:46 - Sara: I feel stupid hahahhahahhhahaha
8/19/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Break ups are difficult, feeling hurt can lead to many negative feelings, sorry
8/19/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also leads to trust issues
8/19/19, 00:47 - Sara: I know
8/19/19, 00:47 - Sara: Now you hate me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8/19/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have much experience with any of that so I'm not handling it very well
8/19/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need time
8/19/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't, at the moment I have to say that the trust I had before is a bit damaged
8/19/19, 00:48 - Sara: Cannot be the same?
8/19/19, 00:48 - Sara: I’m stupid yayyy
8/19/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe can but it takes time
8/19/19, 00:49 - Sara: That kills me 😂😂😂😂
8/19/19, 00:49 - Sara: So my happiness has supposed you being (more) far

8/19/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now it's a rather turbulent time for me so it might be difficult
8/19/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But hopefully at some point it will get better
8/19/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: My situation, I mean
8/19/19, 00:55 - Sara: I don’t know anything now
8/19/19, 00:55 - Sara: Maybe i should stop
8/19/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to tell you what to do, your life, your decisions
8/19/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not closing the door

8/19/19, 00:58 - Sara: Put the limits
8/19/19, 00:59 - Sara: I feel useless in this situation
8/19/19, 00:59 - Sara: Why we make everything more complex
8/19/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, I wanted to start easy, just doing stuff together
8/19/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last few days were a bit unfortunate for that
8/19/19, 01:00 - Sara: Okay

8/19/19, 01:02 - Sara: Made the event more interesting?
8/19/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unfortunately no
8/19/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I cared less
8/19/19, 01:03 - Sara: Not enough then haha
8/19/19, 01:03 - Sara: Nah, alcohol is never the solution
8/19/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on the problem
8/19/19, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, in Patrick Foley it worked fairly well
8/19/19, 01:04 - Sara: In our case... yes
8/19/19, 01:04 - Sara: Probably i would have done without alcohol
8/19/19, 01:04 - Sara: 😂
8/19/19, 01:05 - Sara: But yes, it can be nice to Patrick folley’s to be here again
8/19/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Back to basics, start with sex and then add everything else
8/19/19, 01:06 - Sara: I feel so sad now 😂
8/19/19, 01:07 - Sara: Maybe it can be the opposite in this situation haha
8/19/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/19/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, that's for normal people
8/19/19, 01:08 - Sara: I have never been good at cybersex so xD
8/19/19, 01:08 - Sara: All this situation
8/19/19, 01:09 - Sara: It overwhelms me
8/19/19, 01:10 - Sara: Why life do not let me love you as i want xd
8/19/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because life is cruel
8/19/19, 01:11 - Sara: Why did i have to hurt you xddddd
8/19/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: And Spain is a terrible place xd
8/19/19, 01:11 - Sara: Better than ~Poland~ Twitch
8/19/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Off topic, I just read about a guy who fell asleep on his arm after getting drunk and damaged nerves in his arm
8/19/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: One time after sleeping with you I was kind of afraid of something like that
8/19/19, 01:13 - Sara: I didn’t know it can happen like that
8/19/19, 01:13 - Sara: HAHAHAHHAHA my head is too heavy, i know
8/19/19, 01:13 - Sara: Maybe there was a little possibility to break you any bone
8/19/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Apparently yes, although this was a very unfortunate accident
8/19/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Typically it's not so bad
8/19/19, 01:14 - Sara: Maybe he was sleeping too much
8/19/19, 01:14 - Sara: The best solution is the shower
8/19/19, 01:16 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 01:17 - Sara: So now you know for the next time haha
8/19/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Women are clearly a huge danger for health and well-being 😉
8/19/19, 01:18 - Sara: Definitely
8/19/19, 01:18 - Sara: You checked it in less than one year xd

8/19/19, 01:22 - Sara: What are you doing now?
8/19/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Looking for a mosquito
8/19/19, 01:23 - Sara: Let them be
8/19/19, 01:23 - Sara: And take your blood
8/19/19, 01:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 01:23 - Sara: Making it more accurate
8/19/19, 01:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes they spread diseases, maybe I can get something deadly and all of my problems will be solved
8/19/19, 01:24 - Sara: Kamil, so optimistic
8/19/19, 01:25 - Sara: In which way would you prefer dying?
8/19/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're right, unfortunately it's pretty unlikely that it actually has some nice disease
8/19/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: As soon as possible
8/19/19, 01:26 - Sara: Like ebola?
8/19/19, 01:26 - Sara: So coward
8/19/19, 01:26 - Sara: You don’t enjoy pain
8/19/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: And fast
8/19/19, 01:27 - Sara: And you will die with honor
8/19/19, 01:27 - Sara: Perfect death
8/19/19, 01:28 - Sara: Better smashed by puppies 🐶
8/19/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or just heart attack during sex, that would be perfect
8/19/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Kamil, died doing what he loved"
8/19/19, 01:30 - Sara: I didn’t know you could die drinking in front of the mirror
8/19/19, 01:30 - Sara: Not having aid to breath better
8/19/19, 01:30 - Sara: Air*
8/19/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: That was pretty close already
8/19/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Actually also cool
8/19/19, 01:31 - Sara: Close? 🌚
8/19/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not close enough
8/19/19, 01:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 01:32 - Sara: It hyptonize me, damn
8/19/19, 01:32 - Sara: Have you ever watched 1000 ways of dying?
8/19/19, 01:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/19/19, 01:33 - Sara: Some of them are quite nicd
8/19/19, 01:33 - Sara: A woman died because she cut her pussy while shaving it
8/19/19, 01:33 - Sara: I’m safe 😎
8/19/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
8/19/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I saw one in which a woman died after masturbating with a carrot or something
8/19/19, 01:34 - Sara: Really?
8/19/19, 01:34 - Sara: Many people masturbate with food, really
8/19/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: She cut herself inside or something
8/19/19, 01:35 - Sara: Maybe it was a problem of the carrot
8/19/19, 01:35 - Sara: A carrot is the new knife?
8/19/19, 01:36 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 01:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ8cdL0ELRg

8/19/19, 01:43 - Sara: 🦟
8/19/19, 01:43 - Sara: So cute here 💕
8/19/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I saw it, I almost had it
8/19/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it escaped
8/19/19, 01:44 - Sara: Maybe open the window
8/19/19, 01:46 - Sara: Or more mosquitos can enter xd
8/19/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Amazing idea, higher chance of ebola
8/19/19, 01:48 - Sara: Sooner death 💀 👌🏻
8/19/19, 01:48 - Sara: I have mine open
8/19/19, 01:48 - Sara: 😌
8/19/19, 01:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: South of Spain is basically a desert so of course nothing lives there, not even mosquitos

8/19/19, 02:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Knowing what?
8/19/19, 02:44 - Sara: Well or talking
8/19/19, 02:44 - Sara: I’m sure there must be things we don’t about the other
8/19/19, 02:46 - Sara: Idk, i always think that about people
8/19/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 02:47 - Sara: Is everything okay?

8/19/19, 02:47 - Sara: The mosquito must die
8/19/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if I will go out tomorrow so maybe we can talk tomorrow
8/19/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm feeling quite sleepy
8/19/19, 02:48 - Sara: Okay okay

8/19/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I sent an email and I'm waiting
8/19/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Before when it was closed I immediately got an automated email saying when they will return
8/19/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I didn't receive it so maybe they're back
8/19/19, 13:47 - Sara: Oh, that is nice

8/19/19, 13:51 - Sara: Which plans do you have after your exam? XD
8/19/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I haven't solved anything with uni yet so no clue
8/19/19, 13:52 - Sara: Okay, okay
8/19/19, 13:52 - Sara: Maybe it was a crazy idea 😂
8/19/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
8/19/19, 13:55 - Sara: Definitely I can start walking the 5th of september (one month after the surgery) and my last visit to the doctor is the 10th
8/19/19, 13:55 - Sara: I know you have your exam the 13th
8/19/19, 13:56 - Sara: And well, oficially i start uni the 19th, but i wil only have one class and probably the teacher will explain the course
8/19/19, 13:56 - Sara: So i have a week free
8/19/19, 13:56 - Sara: That’s why i asked
8/19/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I have nothing, at some point after the exam I will have to defend my thesis but that will be a bit later
8/19/19, 13:58 - Sara: One, two weeks later right?
8/19/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least
8/19/19, 13:59 - Sara: Okay okay
8/19/19, 13:59 - Sara: Maybe i can visit you 😂
8/19/19, 14:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's probably expensive
8/19/19, 14:01 - Sara: I haven’t checked it, but probably
8/19/19, 14:01 - Sara: I want to try at least 😁
8/19/19, 14:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have actually two tests btw, one on 13th, second on 14th
8/19/19, 14:04 - Sara: Well, true

8/19/19, 14:56 - Sara: Mmmm okay 👍
8/19/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depending on time

8/19/19, 14:59 - Sara: Is it a safe country?
8/19/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hard to tell
8/19/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: You probably shouldn't mention LGBT or wear rainbows
8/19/19, 15:01 - Sara: What can happen?
8/19/19, 15:01 - Sara: Beat me? D:
8/19/19, 15:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lately there some marches and they ended in some violence so it is a possibility
8/19/19, 15:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: There were*
8/19/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shameful
8/19/19, 15:02 - Sara: Ugh
8/19/19, 15:02 - Sara: Okay, it is okay 😌
8/19/19, 15:02 - Sara: Well... not that much but okay
8/19/19, 15:03 - Sara: Do you know what is a shame?
8/19/19, 15:03 - Sara: That you can say Toledan (from Toledo)
8/19/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall it's not particularly unsafe but better to be careful
8/19/19, 15:03 - Sara: But there is not any word in english for people from CuencA
8/19/19, 15:03 - Sara: Being robbed?
8/19/19, 15:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know about Warsaw and Krakow
8/19/19, 15:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Lodz it's definitely possible
8/19/19, 15:04 - Sara: I can search it
8/19/19, 15:06 - Sara: Which one?
8/19/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Getting robbed
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: There isn’t haha
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: Aahhh i understand
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: I’m so silly
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: Well, idk
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: Maybe normally bigger cities are safer
8/19/19, 15:07 - Sara: But i googled it and it is okay
8/19/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: It depends where you go also, but that's pretty much like everywhere
8/19/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply some places that are better to avoid
8/19/19, 15:08 - Sara: 😢
8/19/19, 15:09 - Sara: Yes, true
8/19/19, 15:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall I don't think Poland is more dangerous
8/19/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also we actually didn't have terrorist attacks like France for example so there is that
8/19/19, 15:10 - Sara: As well
8/19/19, 15:10 - Sara: Or in spain
8/19/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's not USA so probably nobody will just start shooting on the street
8/19/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's nice
8/19/19, 15:11 - Sara: Hahaha true
8/19/19, 15:11 - Sara: I’ll see
8/19/19, 15:11 - Sara: Maybe i cannot travel or something
8/19/19, 15:12 - Sara: Maybe i lose one class but i want to talk with my friends about that
8/19/19, 15:12 - Sara: Or my parents xD
8/19/19, 15:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do as you wish
8/19/19, 15:13 - Sara: Mmmmm no? XD
8/19/19, 15:13 - Sara: Well, in asking yes
8/19/19, 15:13 - Sara: But in visiting someone i need that someone to be available and wanting haha
8/19/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should be available
8/19/19, 15:43 - Sara: Nice
8/19/19, 15:43 - Sara: But do you want?
8/19/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want, I'm not going to say no
8/19/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it can be helpful
8/19/19, 15:46 - Sara: True 😌
8/19/19, 15:47 - Sara: I’ll try
8/19/19, 15:47 - Sara: Have you received the email?
8/19/19, 15:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
8/19/19, 15:52 - Sara: I hope you receive it soon
8/19/19, 15:53 - Sara: And what are you doing?
8/19/19, 15:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was studying some spanish
8/19/19, 15:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'll probably do some more guitar
8/19/19, 15:54 - Sara: Nice 😊
8/19/19, 15:54 - Sara: Indirect object?
8/19/19, 15:54 - Sara: I’ll have the shower of the year
8/19/19, 15:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some vocab, I'll do the indirect object a bit later
8/19/19, 15:58 - Sara: Nice
8/19/19, 15:58 - Sara: Maybe i can prepare a class
8/19/19, 15:58 - Sara: :B
8/19/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not 🙂
8/19/19, 16:05 - Sara: You tell me about what ^^
8/19/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe some tenses
8/19/19, 16:10 - Sara: Tell me which ones you know
8/19/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my vocab app I saw sentences with conjugated verbs like hablaba, estaba etc
8/19/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't not that one yet
8/19/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it could be nice
8/19/19, 16:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also some with debería, podría etc.
8/19/19, 16:25 - Sara: Okay
8/19/19, 16:25 - Sara: And conditionals?
8/19/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how many things I should do at once but sure, why not
8/19/19, 16:52 - Sara: Hahahaha i meant if you know them already
8/19/19, 16:52 - Sara: But little by little
8/19/19, 16:52 - Sara: It is okay ahha i do not want to stress you
8/19/19, 17:06 - Sara: btw 😂:

8/19/19, 18:07 - Sara: You were surprised haha
8/19/19, 18:09 - Sara: Do you feel like doing something later?
8/19/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, we can try
8/19/19, 18:09 - Sara: Around what timeV
8/19/19, 18:09 - Sara: ?
8/19/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: 9?
8/19/19, 18:10 - Sara: Mmmm after my dinner?
8/19/19, 18:10 - Sara: Idk at what time it can be but not that late
8/19/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just text me when you finish the dinner
8/19/19, 18:11 - Sara: Okaay 😃
8/19/19, 21:09 - Sara: Are you there?
8/19/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Poland? Yes, unfortunately
8/19/19, 21:12 - Sara: 😂
8/19/19, 21:13 - Sara: I meant online
8/19/19, 21:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just finished studying
8/19/19, 21:14 - Sara: 👌🏻
8/19/19, 21:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you have plans for later?
8/19/19, 21:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 21:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know why but the quality of the audio is very poor
8/19/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: The second one is ok
8/19/19, 21:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: The first one I cannot understand anything
8/19/19, 21:41 - Sara: My messages you mean?
8/19/19, 21:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/19/19, 21:41 - Sara: Well, i talk a lot so maybe it is that sorry ahha
8/19/19, 21:41 - Sara: Really? I hear them okay
8/19/19, 21:42 - Sara: Oh shit
8/19/19, 21:42 - Sara: It is me xd
8/19/19, 21:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 21:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: This one is fine
8/19/19, 21:44 - Sara: Nice 😌
8/19/19, 21:44 - Sara: So idk if the quality was bad because of me or because of you
8/19/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: So what did you say in the first one?
8/19/19, 21:45 - Sara: This was a summary
8/19/19, 21:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have no clue if it's going to work so maybe it's better if you go with your other plans
8/19/19, 21:47 - Sara: It is okay with that?
8/19/19, 21:47 - Sara: Like if you are not annoyed or something
8/19/19, 21:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm annoyed with my shitty place in which nothing works
8/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: Do not say that man
8/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: It is okay, do not worry
8/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: I will have dinner
8/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: Talk to you later
8/19/19, 21:48 - Sara: Do not worry
8/19/19, 21:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
8/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: Sorry for this >.<
8/19/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not your fault
8/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: I want to talk with you
8/19/19, 21:49 - Sara: Well, that is always
8/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: When are you going to be available tomorrow?
8/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: At 5:30 i have to go to the doctor and around 9 i’ll have plans
8/19/19, 22:02 - Sara: The rest i’m free
8/19/19, 22:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have any plans so probably most of the day I'll be free
8/19/19, 22:04 - Sara: You prefer morning or afternoon
8/19/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe morning, hopefully it will work better
8/19/19, 22:05 - Sara: Okaay
8/19/19, 22:05 - Sara: Around what time?
8/19/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: When would you like?
8/19/19, 22:06 - Sara: 11?
8/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: I don’t mind, probably i’ll have to put my alarm hahaha
8/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: I’m a disaster 😴
8/19/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine for me
8/19/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you want to talk about something specific or just in general?
8/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: We will know
8/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: And you?
8/19/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have anything specific in mind
8/19/19, 22:08 - Sara: So general, and if we think about “us”, we can also mention it
8/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: Or play something
8/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: The one we play about guessing was quite nice, i will always like it
8/19/19, 22:27 - Sara: If you need something, tell me 💕
8/19/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: To make things worse they just turned of the electricity briefly
8/19/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's possible that they will turn it off for longer
8/19/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I might be unavailable
8/19/19, 22:29 - Sara: Tomorrow?
8/19/19, 22:29 - Sara: Why? :o
8/19/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now
8/19/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue, just randomly
8/19/19, 22:30 - Sara: Is wifi a general problem?
8/19/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, it always was
8/19/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: It used to be even worse
8/19/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now there is a bit of hope because possibly I might have optic fiber internet in a few months
8/19/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: So should be much better
8/19/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: But unfortunately I don't know exactly when
8/19/19, 22:32 - Sara: Ob you told me
8/19/19, 22:32 - Sara: I hope soon
8/19/19, 22:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or I will just leave this awful place
8/19/19, 22:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/19/19, 22:32 - Sara: As well
8/19/19, 22:34 - Sara: So good night and talk tomorrow
8/19/19, 22:34 - Sara: At 11 😊
8/19/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully I will emerge from the stone age by then
8/20/19, 02:10 - Sara: Poor Kamil!
8/20/19, 02:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>

8/20/19, 12:03 - Sara: I have prepared it 🤩

8/20/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 12:51 - Sara: Yay!
8/20/19, 12:51 - Sara: Do you want to talk?
8/20/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if it's permanent because sometimes they turn it on for a moment to test something and then turn it off again
8/20/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I went running
8/20/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I need to rest a bit
8/20/19, 12:52 - Sara: That is fine 😌
8/20/19, 12:52 - Sara: Call me or text me if you feel like
8/20/19, 12:52 - Sara: I’ll be reading or resting as well
8/20/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
8/20/19, 12:53 - Sara: 🤗
8/20/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, cool
8/20/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't know I can share it like that
8/20/19, 12:54 - Sara: It is a lot :o
8/20/19, 12:54 - Sara: Cool! Now i now where you live
8/20/19, 12:54 - Sara: Haaha
8/20/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really but I preferred to start slow
8/20/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't been running for a while
8/20/19, 12:55 - Sara: What is the maximum you can do?
8/20/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, at most I think I did around 20km
8/20/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I could probably do a bit more
8/20/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends how fast
8/20/19, 12:56 - Sara: Damn, that is so cool 😎
8/20/19, 12:56 - Sara: Idk how much i can do, a lot of time since i ran for the last time :(
8/20/19, 12:56 - Sara: Don’t force yourself 🤗
8/20/19, 12:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 12:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: This was my way to the uni in Ghent
8/20/19, 12:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: So far
8/20/19, 12:58 - Sara: Yes
8/20/19, 12:59 - Sara: I suppose you have never run to go there hahaha
8/20/19, 12:59 - Sara: 😂😌
8/20/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is my fastest
8/20/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once you start running again you should use that app too
8/20/19, 13:01 - Sara: Is it okay? What does it do?
8/20/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tracks your activities, gives you information about the distance, pace, that sort of things
8/20/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also has some nice workouts
8/20/19, 13:02 - Sara: Cool, i’ll have it in mind
8/20/19, 13:02 - Sara: But it is hard to run in Madrid
8/20/19, 13:03 - Sara: Maybe near my house in Toledo is not that bad, there is a park
8/20/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is only one thing that I like about my place and that is running
8/20/19, 13:04 - Sara: True
8/20/19, 13:04 - Sara: But is there a wood or...?
8/20/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot of forests
8/20/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is why the signal is so bad
8/20/19, 13:07 - Sara: Trees do not give wifi right? 😂
8/20/19, 13:07 - Sara: But in this case you are lucky 😊
8/20/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Useless things, we should get rid of them
8/20/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Who needs oxygen anyway?
8/20/19, 13:09 - Sara: Meh, we can live without them but with money 🤩🤩🤩
8/20/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 13:11 - Sara: Any declaration?
8/20/19, 13:11 - Sara: 😂
8/20/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Autocorrect for the win
8/20/19, 13:12 - Sara: It is the autocorrect keyboard, not you hating Paris 🤨🧐
8/20/19, 13:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it suggests to get rid of France and me, I support that, wholeheartedly
8/20/19, 13:13 - Sara: How can we get rid of you? 😈
8/20/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/20/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: So we don't really need to anymore

8/20/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are going to the doctor today?
8/20/19, 13:19 - Sara: Yep, to get rid of the stitches
8/20/19, 13:19 - Sara: 😁 but i hope it will be fast
8/20/19, 13:25 - Sara: I won’t be knitler anymore :(
8/20/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe not on the outside
8/20/19, 13:28 - Sara: 😈
8/20/19, 13:28 - Sara: 🌚
8/20/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: How was your evening btw?

8/20/19, 13:33 - Sara: And yours? What did you do?
8/20/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, I didn't have electricity so I just read a book
8/20/19, 13:34 - Sara: A real book? With pages full of letters?
8/20/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Define real book
8/20/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was an ebook on my tablet
8/20/19, 13:34 - Sara: Okay haha
8/20/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remind you of lack of electricity
8/20/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: So lack of light
8/20/19, 13:35 - Sara: True
8/20/19, 13:35 - Sara: Was it that dark?
8/20/19, 13:35 - Sara: Wait
8/20/19, 13:35 - Sara: At what time the sun is gone there?
8/20/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Around 8
8/20/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: One hour faster than in Ghent
8/20/19, 13:37 - Sara: Yeah
8/20/19, 13:37 - Sara: Damn
8/20/19, 13:37 - Sara: I’m remembering when we went to Poland
8/20/19, 13:37 - Sara: At 4 it was dark 🤨😂😭
8/20/19, 13:37 - Sara: Hahaha it was insane
8/20/19, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the winter, yes
8/20/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Spain it's not like that?
8/20/19, 13:38 - Sara: Not that soon
8/20/19, 13:38 - Sara: In winter it can be around 7-8

8/22/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And the dates are actually pretty flexible too
8/22/19, 00:09 - Sara: Maybe i’ll have it more expensive but i don’t mind
8/22/19, 00:09 - Sara: Deja vu? :p
8/22/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Interestingly, I see these prices only on the Ryanair website

8/22/19, 00:18 - Sara: Why not? I checked them
8/22/19, 00:18 - Sara: There

8/22/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Clearly not

8/22/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: It shows them but not on the calendar
8/22/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only once I pick the dates
8/22/19, 00:21 - Sara: I know how to see the calendar in ryanair
8/22/19, 00:21 - Sara: I mean
8/22/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the calendar view it showed me the trip for 138 euro
8/22/19, 00:21 - Sara: In skyscanner
8/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: Really? Weirs
8/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: Weird
8/22/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: But when I picked the dates it showed one for 18
8/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: Probably
8/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: Tomorrow i’ll check
8/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: If you see anything else you tell me
8/22/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

8/22/19, 15:59 - Sara: Fair enough
8/22/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's nice
8/22/19, 15:59 - Sara: Do you know more abouf him?

8/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: It was weird but i like being honest with my parents, specially with my mother
8/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: I didn’t say that much, just the overall idea
8/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: She also gave me her point of view
8/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: But yeah, i liked when she said that the only truth is in me so
8/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: fair enough
8/22/19, 16:09 - Sara: So yes
8/22/19, 16:09 - Sara: After the shower i’ll check

8/22/19, 17:03 - Sara: Well, idk well whixh airport is better but seems both are cheap
8/22/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me similar, to Bergamo
8/22/19, 17:06 - Sara: Buah, the flights are quite nice
8/22/19, 17:06 - Sara: I’m checking places to sleep
8/22/19, 17:07 - Sara: I’m sure they will be expensive
8/22/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can also go to Turin

8/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: The cheapest to go to turin is 173€ xd
8/22/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Turin and Milan are pretty close to each other
8/22/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: So if I go to the other one, it's not that much of a problem
8/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: It is better to chose one right?
8/22/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Better, yes, but not necessary if I can have a better flight to Turin
8/22/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Price is similar but I'm looking at hours
8/22/19, 17:10 - Sara: True
8/22/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I could return from a different city
8/22/19, 17:10 - Sara: Rome is 103€ not bad
8/22/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Milan is in the morning, Turin in the evening
8/22/19, 17:10 - Sara: Show me, and i’ll try to adapt
8/22/19, 17:11 - Sara: Wait, from monday to sunday?

8/22/19, 17:11 - Sara: I can do both, but in monday i have to be soon in Spain
8/22/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking at going on Saturday in the evening to Turin or on Sunday morning to Milan
8/22/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you arrive a day later it's not a problem
8/22/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can visit a Lorenzo in Milan

8/22/19, 17:13 - Sara: I’ll see
8/22/19, 17:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: When it comes to Italy we don't have to arrive at the same time or even same place because there are plenty of people to visit there 😊
8/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: Okay 😊
8/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: Your italian family
8/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: The mafia xD

8/22/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll pick whatever seems best
8/22/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would be nice to plan where to go exactly
8/22/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I could pick an airport
8/22/19, 17:19 - Sara: Yep
8/22/19, 17:19 - Sara: I should wait for next week for buying, but we can see
8/22/19, 17:20 - Sara: I have thought about going sunday morning, at 11:25, it is fhe cheapest. Also at 21:35
8/22/19, 17:20 - Sara: What do you have in mind?
8/22/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems fine, I told you, whenever you arrive is fine
8/22/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I won't be alone
8/22/19, 17:21 - Sara: Going back to spain i mean :p
8/22/19, 17:21 - Sara: And about this?
8/22/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure yet, I'll look into it a bit more later
8/22/19, 17:22 - Sara: Okay, you tell me
8/22/19, 17:22 - Sara: Depending on your airport
8/22/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll most likely arrive in Milan in the morning on sunday
8/22/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: For return, probably Saturday
8/22/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm not sure
8/22/19, 17:24 - Sara: I can go back to spain both saturday or sunday
8/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: Damn, apartments are expensive af
8/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: Like minimum about 240€ in total
8/22/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I was thinking about asking the Italians first
8/22/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also I don't intend to stay in one place
8/22/19, 18:00 - Sara: Yes, it is better to go to more places
8/22/19, 18:00 - Sara: Any place you want to go?
8/22/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bologna is probably a must
8/22/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would like to see Florence too
8/22/19, 18:00 - Sara: Are they not far?
8/22/19, 18:00 - Sara: I would like it ♥
8/22/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, quite close
8/22/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: We know a lot of people in Bologna
8/22/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure we can figure out some way to stay there
8/22/19, 18:01 - Sara: True
8/22/19, 18:01 - Sara: Damn, only one hour :o
8/22/19, 18:02 - Sara: Should we ask then?
8/22/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: First I want to be sure of the flights
8/22/19, 18:02 - Sara: Okay ^^
8/22/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although we can probably mention it now
8/22/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just in general, if they will be there in September
8/22/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm pretty sure that they will
8/22/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably some exams and thesis
8/22/19, 18:03 - Sara: Being the third week, yes
8/22/19, 18:03 - Sara: Yep
8/22/19, 18:03 - Sara: They will be there
8/22/19, 18:03 - Sara: Idk if available but they will be haha
8/22/19, 18:04 - Sara: Group? Individually?
8/22/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Individually is probably going to be more effective
8/22/19, 18:07 - Sara: And we can ask for the photos 😈
8/22/19, 18:07 - Sara: And to whom? All of them?
8/22/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, there are not that many
8/22/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can ask for some help
8/22/19, 18:08 - Sara: Nice
8/22/19, 18:08 - Sara: As you said, just mention that we have it in mind
8/22/19, 18:09 - Sara: And btw, why did you change the destination?
8/22/19, 18:09 - Sara: Well, and why did you decide to travel?
8/22/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because Berlin is a bit expensive for you
8/22/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I wanted to visit Italy anyway
8/22/19, 18:09 - Sara: Fair enough
8/22/19, 18:09 - Sara: Me 2 🤗
8/22/19, 18:10 - Sara: Trieste was not enough haha
8/22/19, 18:11 - Sara: Should we have like a route in mind? Maybe we can arrive in X place and leave in Y
8/22/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about something like that but I don't have anything specific yet
8/22/19, 19:23 - Sara: Okay
8/22/19, 19:23 - Sara: Something new?
8/22/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, I was doing something else
8/22/19, 19:23 - Sara: Nice ^^
8/22/19, 19:23 - Sara: Are you okay?
8/22/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/22/19, 19:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
8/22/19, 19:24 - Sara: I’m fine, just doing my exercises and watching videos ^^
8/22/19, 19:25 - Sara: So we will see these days about the trip
8/22/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I checked and I can return to Poland from Bologna
8/22/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Either on Saturday or sunday
8/22/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I would start in Milan, then go to Bologna
8/22/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from there visit also Florence
8/22/19, 22:36 - Sara: I can too, although it is a little bit more expensive than Milan
8/22/19, 22:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if you would have to go back to Milan for the plane it's probably similar
8/22/19, 22:36 - Sara: True, even more expensive
8/22/19, 22:37 - Sara: Which hours have you thought?
8/22/19, 22:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: My options are pretty early
8/22/19, 22:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Around 7-8 in the morning
8/22/19, 22:38 - Sara: Both of them? :o
8/22/19, 22:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I pay like 20 euro more I can have one at 21:15
8/22/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: To a different city but it doesn't really matter that much
8/22/19, 22:39 - Sara: Oh, you are more limited than me then
8/22/19, 22:39 - Sara: Depending on the day, it is more or less cheap
8/22/19, 22:39 - Sara: That is what we have to decide
8/22/19, 22:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: The cheapest I have goes on Sunday at 9:35
8/22/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: For 41 euro
8/22/19, 22:41 - Sara: One second
8/22/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it stops in vienna
8/22/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: For like 10 hours
8/22/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't really mind
8/22/19, 22:42 - Sara: Mine at 12:50 for 62€
8/22/19, 22:42 - Sara: Really? Sure?
8/22/19, 22:43 - Sara: I don’t recommend it unless you sightsee
8/22/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Actually I found a better one
8/22/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the same hour but waits only 3 or 4 hours and goes to Warsaw instead of krakow
8/22/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: And only 8 euro more
8/22/19, 22:43 - Sara: Nice
8/22/19, 22:44 - Sara: Where are you seeing them?
8/22/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Skyscanner
8/22/19, 22:44 - Sara: Okay
8/22/19, 22:44 - Sara: Same hour as this?

8/22/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Through vienna
8/22/19, 22:56 - Sara: I mean in italy :p
8/22/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I found a flight on Saturday, 14th to Turin for 14 euro
8/22/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's the best for me
8/22/19, 22:57 - Sara: Okay
8/22/19, 22:57 - Sara: I’ll see what i can do
8/22/19, 22:57 - Sara: Maybe you can go to milan on monday
8/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should arrive in Milan at 20:25 so I think I'll try to go to Milan immediately
8/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later I'll ask Lorenzo
8/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Turin
8/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not in Milan
8/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whoops
8/22/19, 22:59 - Sara: Okay
8/22/19, 22:59 - Sara: What can we do like...? 2 days each place?
8/22/19, 22:59 - Sara: Or maybe i can go somewhere else for you not to be 4 days there... or it is okay?
8/22/19, 22:59 - Sara: Thanks 🤗
8/22/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's fine, some time in Milan, then to Bologna
8/22/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from there we can decide
8/22/19, 23:00 - Sara: Mmmm it is not florence nearer?
8/22/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if there is that much to see there
8/22/19, 23:00 - Sara: Milan? Not really
8/22/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: But we can probably stay in Bologna, like sleep, I mean
8/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from there see stuff around
8/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: Yes, fair enough
8/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Florence is close so we can go and return to Bologna the same day
8/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: But i’d arrive on monday morning to milan, can i visit it in one day?
8/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: Yep

8/23/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I couldn't hear you either xd
8/23/19, 02:46 - Sara: :p
8/23/19, 02:46 - Sara: That was weird :p
8/23/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you need to sleep to recover
8/23/19, 02:46 - Sara: True
8/23/19, 02:46 - Sara: You too
8/23/19, 02:47 - Sara: Idk it is weird because idk what to do when i’m sad
8/23/19, 02:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, idk if I can help with that
8/23/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: When I try it typically doesn't work very well
8/23/19, 02:48 - Sara: Try what?
8/23/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Try to help with sadness
8/23/19, 02:48 - Sara: Why do you say that?
8/23/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because most of the time you don't seem any happier after talking to me
8/23/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I failed
8/23/19, 02:49 - Sara: No man
8/23/19, 02:49 - Sara: Do not say that
8/23/19, 02:49 - Sara: You do know it is not true
8/23/19, 02:50 - Sara: It is not because of you
8/23/19, 02:50 - Sara: Certain topics still hurt
8/23/19, 02:51 - Sara: And well, what i like when i’m being sad, even for the most stupid thing, is being with someone
8/23/19, 02:51 - Sara: And in this kind of things it is like “what should i do?” Xd
8/23/19, 02:52 - Sara: But i’m better just expressing it like this
8/23/19, 02:52 - Sara: Thanks
8/23/19, 02:53 - Sara: So it is not your fault
8/23/19, 02:53 - Sara: If the present is different, why should i care about the past?
8/23/19, 02:54 - Sara: But not understanding or not knowing things can “worry”
8/23/19, 02:54 - Sara: But again, not true at all
8/23/19, 02:55 - Sara: If you knew how happy i am talking to you
8/23/19, 02:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Care maybe not, but remember for sure, to not repeat the same mistakes
8/23/19, 02:56 - Sara: Of course
8/23/19, 02:57 - Sara: It is about not blaming myself for the bad things that happen to me
8/23/19, 02:58 - Sara: I do not want you to feel that 😭
8/23/19, 02:58 - Sara: It is just a bit hard, but i’m accepting it
8/23/19, 02:59 - Sara: Sorry 😐
8/23/19, 03:03 - Sara: You help, you know
8/23/19, 03:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: None of that was your fault
8/23/19, 03:04 - Sara: But i do not want to feel like this when it is Not true
8/23/19, 03:05 - Sara: Just have my moments, but not because of you
8/23/19, 03:05 - Sara: You help minimum by being there
8/23/19, 03:05 - Sara: And yes, time to go to sleep
8/23/19, 03:06 - Sara: You should visit me 4 times a week for not forgetting you, even more 💕
8/23/19, 03:10 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:11 - Sara: I really liked talking with you, and i’m excited for the trip. It will be great ♥
8/23/19, 03:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: If anything, at least there will be carbonara ☺️
8/23/19, 03:12 - Sara: Nothing to complain about 🍝 ♥
8/23/19, 03:13 - Sara: Go to sleep, owl
8/23/19, 03:13 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ljubljana mood, I think I will go running
8/23/19, 03:14 - Sara: Really?
8/23/19, 03:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, with the 🦌 and 🐗
8/23/19, 03:14 - Sara: For their well being... don’t take the car
8/23/19, 03:15 - Sara: Running now? 💤
8/23/19, 03:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🏃🏃🏃
8/23/19, 03:16 - Sara: And why you said you were tired? Hahah
8/23/19, 03:16 - Sara: Then i’m the one who change a lot hehehe
8/23/19, 03:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm tired but when I try to fall asleep I'm not tired anymore
8/23/19, 03:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's weird and annoying
8/23/19, 03:17 - Sara: Are you always like that?
8/23/19, 03:17 - Sara: Is it*
8/23/19, 03:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of
8/23/19, 03:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm jealous of people who just go to bed and fall asleep immediately
8/23/19, 03:18 - Sara: Well, that depends of so many factors
8/23/19, 03:18 - Sara: I’m sure when you are quite tired you sleep like that
8/23/19, 03:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I study the whole night xd
8/23/19, 03:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Around 7-8 a.m. I probably will
8/23/19, 03:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:19 - Sara: Really only in that situation?
8/23/19, 03:20 - Sara: Just establish your natural schedule
8/23/19, 03:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I don't use enough energy during the day
8/23/19, 03:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to run more
8/23/19, 03:20 - Sara: Yep
8/23/19, 03:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe a marathon every day will be enough
8/23/19, 03:20 - Sara: Exercising more you can feel more tired
8/23/19, 03:21 - Sara: Or just sleep during the day and do your routine at night
8/23/19, 03:21 - Sara: Realistic haha
8/23/19, 03:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you tell me I cannot do it, I will do it
8/23/19, 03:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then I will die soon after
8/23/19, 03:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Win-win
8/23/19, 03:23 - Sara: Better for everybody
8/23/19, 03:23 - Sara: You can do it, but be careful
8/23/19, 03:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: With the 🐗 🐗 🐗?
8/23/19, 03:23 - Sara: As well
8/23/19, 03:24 - Sara: Careful with the possibility of heart attack, faint or fight with wild pigs
8/23/19, 03:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm kidding but I will eventually start running more
8/23/19, 03:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I start now with short distance, around 6k
8/23/19, 03:24 - Sara: That is nice! If that make you feel better, it is fine 😁
8/23/19, 03:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But later I want to do at least 10k
8/23/19, 03:25 - Sara: Idk why but i have imagined you fighting with the boars as putin shirtless riding a horse
8/23/19, 03:25 - Sara: Little by little you will be able ^^
8/23/19, 03:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't tell me you're getting horny now xd
8/23/19, 03:26 - Sara: Horny with Putin? Definitely
8/23/19, 03:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:27 - Sara: But not denying you (being shirtless) is nice
8/23/19, 03:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 03:32 - Sara: Better to go to sleep 😂
8/23/19, 03:32 - Sara: See you tomorrow! Good night 💤
8/23/19, 03:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good night (soon good morning)

8/23/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola gordita, bien, y tú?
8/23/19, 17:50 - Sara: 😂
8/23/19, 17:50 - Sara: I’m a sleepy gordita
8/23/19, 17:50 - Sara: I’m nice but i feel tired
8/23/19, 17:51 - Sara: I went to the rehearsal rooms this morning
8/23/19, 17:51 - Sara: What about you?
8/23/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, just standard
8/23/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I talked with Lorenzo
8/23/19, 17:52 - Sara: Tell me
8/23/19, 17:52 - Sara: I was about to ask to enrico, nicco, thelma and elia
8/23/19, 17:52 - Sara: Anyone else?
8/23/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: His birthday is on Saturday, the 14th of September

8/23/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also asked Enrico if he will be in Bologna in September but he hasn't responded yet
8/23/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will also ask Niccolò
8/23/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can ask Elía and Thelma
8/23/19, 17:54 - Sara: I can if you feel like
8/23/19, 17:54 - Sara: 👌🏻
8/23/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or I can do it, for me it's whatever
8/23/19, 17:55 - Sara: I want to feel useful, i can haha
8/23/19, 17:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara the useless, it's like a title
8/23/19, 17:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like mother of dragons
8/23/19, 17:56 - Sara: Sara I the useless
8/23/19, 17:56 - Sara: V the disaster
8/23/19, 17:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Breakdown queen

8/23/19, 17:57 - Sara: Sounds so nice ♥♥♥
8/23/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sort of cute, completely useless

8/23/19, 18:01 - Sara: :3
8/23/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Imaginary and weak?
8/23/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough
8/23/19, 18:02 - Sara: Weak?
8/23/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also short
8/23/19, 18:02 - Sara: And sing good 🎤🎶
8/23/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fake news
8/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: Completely real
8/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: Already asked
8/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: What did you do?
8/23/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just the everyday stuff and I looked at flights
8/23/19, 18:05 - Sara: Something new about the flight?
8/23/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I looked at different options and I decided to take on from Warsaw to Milan
8/23/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will arrive in Bergamo at 7:30 a.m. on sunday
8/23/19, 18:06 - Sara: Pufff so soon?
8/23/19, 18:06 - Sara: Or that is the cheapest?
8/23/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, most reasonable
8/23/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I actually go from Warsaw on Saturday evening
8/23/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a stop in Vienna
8/23/19, 18:07 - Sara: Fuck Vienna
8/23/19, 18:07 - Sara: And for how long?
8/23/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Around 7-8 hours I think, I'm not sure
8/23/19, 18:09 - Sara: Okay, but i will always not recommend it xd
8/23/19, 18:09 - Sara: And somethinf about places?
8/23/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Milan I think Lorenzo can show us most of the stuff
8/23/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later I'll ask about a place to stay
8/23/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess we can just ask the Italians
8/23/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's their country, they probably have some ideas
8/23/19, 18:11 - Sara: 👍
8/23/19, 18:11 - Sara: Any plan for today?
8/23/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
8/23/19, 18:13 - Sara: You seem busy xD
8/23/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: How so?
8/23/19, 18:13 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/23/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do I seem busy?
8/23/19, 18:14 - Sara: Hahaha
8/23/19, 18:14 - Sara: Short answers probably
8/23/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vertically challenged answers, come on Sara, be inclusive
8/23/19, 18:16 - Sara: Vertically challenged?
8/23/19, 18:16 - Sara: Nah, no excuses for laziness
8/23/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Saying short is not very nice, vertically challenged is a more thoughtful alternative
8/23/19, 18:18 - Sara: Not enough xD
8/23/19, 18:18 - Sara: How can i answer with that? XD
8/23/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You cannot, you lost
8/23/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Looooooser
8/23/19, 18:19 - Sara: I caaaaaan
8/23/19, 18:19 - Sara: You can just look haha
8/23/19, 18:19 - Sara: I’m always the talkative one ;p
8/23/19, 19:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 20:00 - Sara: Btw, i felt ready and i started to walk with my crutches
8/23/19, 20:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you already did that before, no?
8/23/19, 20:26 - Sara: Not stepping with my left leg
8/23/19, 20:27 - Sara: So it is an important step
8/23/19, 20:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/23/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: "That's one small step for Sara, one irrelevant leap for mankind" - Sara de la Torre, 2019
8/23/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seriously though, that's great, how did it go?
8/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: Definitely xD
8/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: I tried with my mother in the living room, just in case
8/23/19, 21:06 - Sara: Because the exercises the doctor told me... well, i got bored, i didn’t feel any “limit” or pain or something like that (that means that you have to work on it)
8/23/19, 21:07 - Sara: So it is nice, most of the weight is still in the crutches but at least i have seen progress
8/23/19, 21:08 - Sara: After walking i feel “pain” (not walking for 2 weeks means a lot), so i’ll do the exercises afterwards
8/23/19, 21:08 - Sara: So i’m happy, although i prefer doing it seriously (in the street, more often) next week
8/23/19, 21:08 - Sara: Idk if on monday or on thursday
8/23/19, 21:14 - Sara: Thelma:

8/23/19, 21:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Enrico hasn't responded yet
8/23/19, 21:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: If that won't work, I'll also ask my friends from Florence

8/24/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or we can take one day to visit
8/24/19, 13:43 - Sara: Depending on when we arrive to Bologna
8/24/19, 13:43 - Sara: True ::
8/24/19, 13:43 - Sara: :3
8/24/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: He told me that we can come to Asti which is 🆑 se to Milan and he can pick us up with a car
8/24/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Close*

8/24/19, 13:43 - Sara: That can be nice
8/24/19, 13:44 - Sara: Should we organize everyrhing before or after buying the tickets?
8/24/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Plane tickets as soon as possible
8/24/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: The rest we can plan later
8/24/19, 13:44 - Sara: Okay
8/24/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe Monday, Tuesday in Milan, Wednesday with Nicco and then to Bologna
8/24/19, 13:45 - Sara: Next week, i promise. Possibly on monday
8/24/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from there Florence and whatever else
8/24/19, 13:45 - Sara: Okay 😌
8/24/19, 13:45 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/24/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing at the moment, I just started texting you
8/24/19, 13:46 - Sara: Nice, feel important 😎
8/24/19, 13:47 - Sara: It could have been nice trying to go to Geniva but maybe is a different direction right?
8/24/19, 13:47 - Sara: It is on the west
8/24/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe we can go with Nicco
8/24/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not that far from Asti
8/24/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't think there is much to see in Racca
8/24/19, 13:49 - Sara: I’ll check it
8/24/19, 13:49 - Sara: Racca?
8/24/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: His hometown
8/24/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's not even on the map, I think
8/24/19, 13:49 - Sara: Hahahhahaha we can try to talk with him
8/24/19, 13:50 - Sara: I cannot even find it on goggle haha
8/24/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked Nicco about Genoa
8/24/19, 13:55 - Sara: 😎
8/24/19, 13:55 - Sara: What are you going to do now?
8/24/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, probably study something
8/24/19, 13:56 - Sara: Nice, go hard then ^^
8/24/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Erection is not very useful for studying but thanks, I guess...
8/24/19, 13:57 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
8/24/19, 13:57 - Sara: Lack of concentration? 🤔
8/24/19, 14:05 - Sara: I found the perfect ad for you 😂
https://twitter.com/astritloku/status/1163508553048608771?s=12
8/24/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hideous little creatures, terrible, taxing burdens
8/24/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Completely agreed
8/24/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw Nicco said that going yo Genoa is should be quite nice and possible to do
8/24/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also he already proposed a plan for what to do there
8/24/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can get drunk with the wine
8/24/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: The good one
8/24/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm interested
8/24/19, 14:42 - Sara: And visit Mara ♥
8/24/19, 14:42 - Sara: I can ask her if she will be there :3
8/24/19, 14:42 - Sara: Sounds very nice, in fact
8/24/19, 14:42 - Sara: I like it
8/24/19, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Getting drunk in Italy?

8/24/19, 15:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure
8/24/19, 15:20 - Sara: Great 💜
8/24/19, 15:20 - Sara: How is it going? Resting for 5 minutes?
8/24/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Wait, you want to have sex with her?
8/24/19, 15:21 - Sara: Always
8/24/19, 15:21 - Sara: HAHAHAHHAHA
8/24/19, 15:21 - Sara: 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
8/24/19, 22:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/24/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Going out?
8/24/19, 22:55 - Sara: In my friend’s house
8/24/19, 22:56 - Sara: We have just watched Frozen and Ready Player One
8/24/19, 22:56 - Sara: After, yes
8/24/19, 22:56 - Sara: How are you?
8/24/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing special
8/24/19, 23:10 - Sara: What have you been doing?
8/24/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just regular stuff
8/24/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I went running
8/24/19, 23:14 - Sara: Nice
8/24/19, 23:14 - Sara: How are you feeling?
8/24/19, 23:29 - Sara: 😭😭😭
8/24/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened?
8/24/19, 23:34 - Sara: They don’t let me go out
8/24/19, 23:35 - Sara: Ugh
8/24/19, 23:35 - Sara: I feel sad
8/24/19, 23:35 - Sara: And ignored ugh
8/24/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was busy
8/24/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your parents?
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: Yes
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: My sister is like my mother
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: Ugh
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: They told me i could
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: And my friend neither tried to adapt it
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: They don’t care about me
8/24/19, 23:44 - Sara: Feel like shit
8/24/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Adapt what?
8/24/19, 23:45 - Sara: Plans
8/24/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that, but what exactly?
8/24/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, considering you haven't recovered yet, do you really think it's wise to go out?
8/24/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Possibly sacrificing long term improvement over immediate pleasure?
8/24/19, 23:48 - Sara: Mmmm i hurts when they told me i could go out
8/24/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think they just care about you and don't want you to hurt yourself
8/24/19, 23:49 - Sara: Again
8/24/19, 23:49 - Sara: .
8/24/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe after thinking about it they changed their mind, it happens
8/24/19, 23:50 - Sara: Idk
8/24/19, 23:50 - Sara: Meh
8/24/19, 23:50 - Sara: I will have a walk on my own
8/24/19, 23:51 - Sara: Maybe i’m more fucked up for that
8/24/19, 23:51 - Sara: Well, it is both xD
8/24/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know exactly what kind of changes they would need to make but it seems like you expect a lot from them
8/24/19, 23:52 - Sara: From my friends?
8/24/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/24/19, 23:53 - Sara: Normally friends cared about me
8/24/19, 23:53 - Sara: Other friends even wanted me in their plans for going to the valley, as adapt it for me
8/24/19, 23:53 - Sara: Who cares about me? C:
8/24/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know the whole context but it looks to me like you're a bit overly dramatic about this
8/24/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: But maybe it's just my messed up perspective
8/24/19, 23:55 - Sara: As always
8/24/19, 23:55 - Sara: Thanks c:
8/24/19, 23:56 - Sara: That what i needed
8/24/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seriously, why do you think nobody cares about you?
8/24/19, 23:57 - Sara: At least thia group
8/24/19, 23:57 - Sara: Idk
8/25/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also this
8/25/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: So someone wanted you to come
8/25/19, 00:02 - Sara: But not these ones
8/25/19, 00:04 - Sara: I fee like crying so xd
8/25/19, 00:04 - Sara: It is better to call you in another moment
8/25/19, 00:05 - Sara: But yes
8/25/19, 00:05 - Sara: What do you want to say?
8/25/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wouldn't mind to know the whole story so I could decide who do I think is an asshole here
8/25/19, 00:06 - Sara: 😂😂😂
8/25/19, 00:06 - Sara: Nobody is an asshole
8/25/19, 00:06 - Sara: It is normal for then to do it
8/25/19, 00:06 - Sara: Them* xd
8/25/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you are disappointed with them for not adapting to you
8/25/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
8/25/19, 00:07 - Sara: I wanted to go out in general
8/25/19, 00:07 - Sara: And yes, like changing plans all of a sudden from my parents
8/25/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still confused
8/25/19, 00:08 - Sara: Do not worry
8/25/19, 00:08 - Sara: It is okay
8/25/19, 00:09 - Sara: Tell me what have you been doing
8/25/19, 00:09 - Sara: Why?
8/25/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 00:10 - Sara: Cool
8/25/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still don't really know what happened
8/25/19, 00:11 - Sara: I could go out in the city centre, my parents told me
8/25/19, 00:11 - Sara: I went to my friend’s house and all of a sudden my parents tell me i cannot
8/25/19, 00:11 - Sara: My friends not even try to adapt it to me
8/25/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Adapting would mean staying in the house?
8/25/19, 00:12 - Sara: Even my sister did not help me
8/25/19, 00:12 - Sara: I’m not a pillow
8/25/19, 00:12 - Sara: I can have a walk in more or less flat streets
8/25/19, 00:13 - Sara: And go to bars and so on
8/25/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can understand your parents not letting you go, one wrong step could mean possibly another surgery and even more recovery
8/25/19, 00:14 - Sara: I feel frustrated and ignored
8/25/19, 00:14 - Sara: Because if i know i cannot go out it is okay
8/25/19, 00:15 - Sara: I can do other plans or whatever
8/25/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree that changing their mind like that is not great
8/25/19, 00:15 - Sara: And again, my friends and my sister not doing anythinf
8/25/19, 00:15 - Sara: At least Christian wants to come
8/25/19, 00:16 - Sara: I’m laying in a banch near my house
8/25/19, 00:17 - Sara: This is amazing xD
8/25/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara the homeless xd
8/25/19, 00:17 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 00:18 - Sara: I don’t like people noticing i’m sad, as especially now my parents xd
8/25/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you don't realize how lucky you are with having such a family and friends
8/25/19, 00:19 - Sara: Why do you say that?
8/25/19, 00:20 - Sara: I know they take care of me and i really feel good with that, i do not deny it
8/25/19, 00:20 - Sara: I feel blessed with that
8/25/19, 00:21 - Sara: Cannot i be sad?
8/25/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can, of course
8/25/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just think if you actually have good reasons to be sad
8/25/19, 00:22 - Sara: Explain me
8/25/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your family clearly cares about you, they don't want you to get hurt, maybe they are a bit overprotective but well, that's better than just not giving a shit at all
8/25/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: As for your friends, they didn't adapt, well, you have other friends that are willing to do that so that's great
8/25/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not every friend is a best friend
8/25/19, 00:25 - Sara: True
8/25/19, 00:25 - Sara: I know, but yes, makes me feel useless or as a handicap
8/25/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: In your current state I suppose you are a bit of a handicap, not going to lie
8/25/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: But remember that it is so that you can be healthy again
8/25/19, 00:26 - Sara: 😒
8/25/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: So yes, now it's a bit painful, but again, long term gain
8/25/19, 00:26 - Sara: Perfect that people do not care a shit about you 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
8/25/19, 00:27 - Sara: Even my uni friends are going to come from Madrid to see me, c’mon
8/25/19, 00:27 - Sara: It is like
8/25/19, 00:27 - Sara: Idk what to think, if i am honest
8/25/19, 00:27 - Sara: I’m my sister’s sister probably
8/25/19, 00:28 - Sara: But please, do not make me feel that my feelings are fake or useless. Can you take me seriously at least once? I didn’t like your comment about me being dramatic or exagerated
8/25/19, 00:29 - Sara: That is rude
8/25/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm just asking you to be reasonable
8/25/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't explained my reasoning about your family and friends
8/25/19, 00:30 - Sara: I am
8/25/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't jump to conclusions that nobody cares about you
8/25/19, 00:30 - Sara: What do you mean?
8/25/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I explained*
8/25/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how that don't got there
8/25/19, 00:31 - Sara: Some does, i know
8/25/19, 00:31 - Sara: But yes, the situation has been weird
8/25/19, 00:32 - Sara: Again, being let down
8/25/19, 00:33 - Sara: And i don’t like being set aside like rubbish
8/25/19, 00:33 - Sara: Nobody
8/25/19, 00:34 - Sara: Besides i care about the people who cares, i know that it is only 1-2 weeks and later i’ll be perfect (i hope)
8/25/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, your parents told you to return, your friends were supposed to convince them otherwise or what exactly?
8/25/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know the whole context so it still confuses me a bit
8/25/19, 00:35 - Sara: Not really
8/25/19, 00:36 - Sara: But i could stay if the plans were okay for me, or at least in a place  i can walk easily or somerhinf
8/25/19, 00:36 - Sara: But i’m not the centre of the universe neither xD
8/25/19, 00:37 - Sara: So i’m as well confused
8/25/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's what put me off to be honest, sounded kind of selfish before
8/25/19, 00:37 - Sara: Why?
8/25/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for being harsh but it was hard for me to be supportive of that
8/25/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you know that selfishness is not really my style
8/25/19, 00:38 - Sara: A group of guys is approaching to me c:
8/25/19, 00:38 - Sara: I hope they pass along
8/25/19, 00:38 - Sara: Tell me why
8/25/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess that's just my background, I never really thought about bothering anybody with myself and my problems
8/25/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: It probably wasn't the best approach
8/25/19, 00:40 - Sara: But it is not always selfishness
8/25/19, 00:40 - Sara: I’ll be aitb christian btw
8/25/19, 00:41 - Sara: If i do not answer
8/25/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, have fun
8/25/19, 00:41 - Sara: I’ll try
8/25/19, 00:41 - Sara: You should not call selfishness asking dor company and help
8/25/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but asking someone to change the plans they already had just for me?
8/25/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something that good friends would do, for sure
8/25/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But not really something I would ask for
8/25/19, 00:59 - Sara: You said it
8/25/19, 00:59 - Sara: Why not if they are your friends? Why mot even trying?
8/25/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I don't think I deserve that
8/25/19, 01:06 - Sara: Of course you deserve it
8/25/19, 01:06 - Sara: People who cares about you will do what is possible to make you feel okay
8/25/19, 01:06 - Sara: That is what i see it
8/25/19, 01:08 - Sara: If people make you feel like that, it is a prpblem
8/25/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 01:24 - Sara: Crying for twitch? Really? Haha
8/25/19, 01:30 - Sara: Since when you care? :p
8/25/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's more about Ghent in general
8/25/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: And there were some good moments in Twitch after all
8/25/19, 01:44 - Sara: I agree a lot
8/25/19, 01:44 - Sara: emergency exit...
8/25/19, 01:44 - Sara: 🚨
8/25/19, 02:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/V65XR4eMp-4
8/25/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: YouTube algorithm decided that this is a video for me
8/25/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't know there was a Spanish version
8/25/19, 02:10 - Sara: Me neither :o
8/25/19, 02:10 - Sara: How is it?
8/25/19, 02:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know why these guys are in some sort of uniforms but it's ok, I like the original more
8/25/19, 02:11 - Sara: Lady gaga is better always haha
8/25/19, 02:11 - Sara: Maybe sounds weird in spanish?
8/25/19, 02:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe if it was recorded more professionally, I don't know
8/25/19, 02:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Considering the conditions I still think it's very good and the guy sings really well
8/25/19, 02:27 - Sara: I will watch it later
8/25/19, 02:27 - Sara: What are you doing so late?
8/25/19, 02:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have some difficulty sleeping lately
8/25/19, 02:30 - Sara: True
8/25/19, 02:30 - Sara: Try to sleep and relax
8/25/19, 02:30 - Sara: Insomnia?
8/25/19, 02:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Too much on my mind
8/25/19, 02:35 - Sara: What do you think? You can always tell me
8/25/19, 02:35 - Sara: Or writing it
8/25/19, 04:16 - Sara: Sounds like a serenade 💕
8/25/19, 12:33 - Sara: Good morning 😃
8/25/19, 12:33 - Sara: Hello there
8/25/19, 13:38 - Sara: Would you like to do something this afternoon/evening?
8/25/19, 13:41 - Sara: https://youtu.be/4qKGWY1T32k 🤗
8/25/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hello, yeah, why not, I'm not sure when exactly but yes
8/25/19, 13:52 - Sara: Busy?
8/25/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I do have some stuff that I would like to do before that, but that's like everyday
8/25/19, 13:53 - Sara: True
8/25/19, 13:53 - Sara: You tell me if you can, i will stay at home
8/25/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
8/25/19, 13:54 - Sara: Meh, feeling indifference
8/25/19, 13:54 - Sara: I know more info about yesterday
8/25/19, 13:54 - Sara: So i prefer staying in my room
8/25/19, 13:54 - Sara: You?
8/25/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing special, just like every other day 😔
8/25/19, 13:55 - Sara: Do not be sad
8/25/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want to talk?
8/25/19, 13:55 - Sara: It is okay
8/25/19, 13:55 - Sara: Guada was there and he told me they stayed most of the time sitting in a place
8/25/19, 13:56 - Sara: So i’m like
8/25/19, 13:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 13:57 - Sara: Before they told me “nah, we don’t want to sit because then we get bored And tired”
8/25/19, 13:57 - Sara: And i asked my sister about yesterday and she only said “good”
8/25/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, sorry to hear that, that's rather shitty from them but do you think they did it on purpose?
8/25/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good what?
8/25/19, 14:00 - Sara: I don’t know
8/25/19, 14:00 - Sara: How was the plan
8/25/19, 14:00 - Sara: And at least she can be honest (?
8/25/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Honestly, I am a little bit lost on the situation with your sister
8/25/19, 14:02 - Sara: It is okay
8/25/19, 14:02 - Sara: Do not worry
8/25/19, 14:02 - Sara: Like../ mmmm she can talk to me more?
8/25/19, 14:02 - Sara: But yes, maybe it is because i did not ask
8/25/19, 14:03 - Sara: Idk, at the moment i feel happy reading Hamlet
8/25/19, 14:04 - Sara: I prefer to forget the problem and move on
8/25/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's not like you can do anything about it so I agree about moving on
8/25/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: One or two more weeks and you'll be good as new  🙂
8/25/19, 14:05 - Sara: I hope 😁
8/25/19, 14:06 - Sara: But yes
8/25/19, 14:06 - Sara: It has been so fast
8/25/19, 14:06 - Sara: Any news?
8/25/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, it's Sunday so of course nothing
8/25/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully tomorrow or on tuesday
8/25/19, 14:07 - Sara: Nice 👌🏻
8/25/19, 14:07 - Sara: And anything in mind?
8/25/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Keep studying for the exam, Spanish, guitar, I bought myself a very nice programming course that I hope will be very helpful with finding a job
8/25/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 14:10 - Sara: Nice! How long is the course?
8/25/19, 14:10 - Sara: Wonderful ♥
8/25/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I recently read that polish pianist Andre Tchaikovsky donated his skull to a theatre
8/25/19, 14:10 - Sara: Damn
8/25/19, 14:10 - Sara: That is fantastic
8/25/19, 14:10 - Sara: I hope it does not break xD
8/25/19, 14:11 - Sara: Will you donate your corpse?
8/25/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: 186 lectures, 24 hours of videos
8/25/19, 14:12 - Sara: That is a lot haha
8/25/19, 14:13 - Sara: Do you have to do it in a certain period od time or...?
8/25/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, I bought it so I can do it whenever I want
8/25/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I want to do it as fast as possible because in November there will be a job fair in Lodz
8/25/19, 14:14 - Sara: Oh! And what is ir for?
8/25/19, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I would like to find something where I would work with the contents of that course
8/25/19, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just different companies set up in a huge expo building
8/25/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can walk around, talk about jobs
8/25/19, 14:15 - Sara: You working in something with informatics?
8/25/19, 14:15 - Sara: That is always a good option o see your possibilities
8/25/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ideally I would want something in between electronics and programming
8/25/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I saw some offers like that so it's possible
8/25/19, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: But anything that would include programming in that particular language I'm learning now will be fine
8/25/19, 14:17 - Sara: Yes, any extra skill is good
8/25/19, 14:17 - Sara: But is there only one programming language?
8/25/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a lot of them
8/25/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: The basics of programming are typically very similar, just the syntax is a bit different
8/25/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I'm not really starting from zero now that I learn a new one
8/25/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: The basics I can learn in one week, maybe faster
8/25/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like python language because of it's applications
8/25/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: And basically every large company uses it
8/25/19, 14:20 - Sara: And then you will learn more languages?
8/25/19, 14:20 - Sara: Niceee
8/25/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Possibly, if necessary but typically it's not, I think
8/25/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Making the change doesn't really take a lot of time
8/25/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Companies look for developers in a specific programming language
8/25/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: They don't just look for programmers
8/25/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: They specify, for example python developer or Java developer
8/25/19, 14:23 - Sara: Ohh okay okay
8/25/19, 14:23 - Sara: So yes, it is okay to learn that one
8/25/19, 14:23 - Sara: And then depending on the company you can learn one or another
8/25/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can just search for jobs in this specific area, there is a lot of that
8/25/19, 14:24 - Sara: Fair enough
8/25/19, 14:24 - Sara: And you want to give CV’s in that expo?
8/25/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would like to
8/25/19, 14:25 - Sara: I hope you’ll have luck 😌
8/25/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 14:31 - Sara: Not funny 😂
8/25/19, 14:31 - Sara: But it is a weird slogan for that campaign xD
8/25/19, 14:32 - Sara: Reddit?
8/25/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 14:33 - Sara: Hahahhaha that one is harsh
8/25/19, 14:33 - Sara: Oh, you are also an engineer xD
8/25/19, 14:33 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

8/25/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 15:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not possible for you to stay any longer than Sunday the 22nd of September, right?
8/25/19, 15:43 - Sara: 23rd
8/25/19, 15:44 - Sara: XD
8/25/19, 15:44 - Sara: Why?
8/25/19, 15:50 - Sara: I wanted that monday free in case i have to do something with internship but i think the best will be starting in october (if any highschool chose me)
8/25/19, 15:50 - Sara: Also for being able to take fhe notes for the classes i won’t go
8/25/19, 15:51 - Sara: But if i arrive partially soon i can stay until monday
8/25/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Go whenever you need, I just don't like very much my flights on Sunday so I may stay a bit longer
8/25/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like Tuesday, maybe Wednesday
8/25/19, 16:07 - Sara: Cheaper?
8/25/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
8/25/19, 16:08 - Sara: I’ll check later
8/25/19, 16:08 - Sara: Up to you
8/25/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, you can return whenever you want, I'll just stay with my friends, no problem
8/25/19, 16:09 - Sara: Okay
8/25/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or more like whenever you have to
8/25/19, 16:09 - Sara: I’ll do that
8/25/19, 16:09 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/25/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish
8/25/19, 16:09 - Sara: Nice
8/25/19, 16:10 - Sara: Something in concrete?
8/25/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a few short texts to write
8/25/19, 16:10 - Sara: About what?
8/25/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last few lessons were mostly about past tenses
8/25/19, 16:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: About someone famous, about a travel anecdote and the rest I don't remember
8/25/19, 16:11 - Sara: Nice ^^ you can show me when you finish them
8/25/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I had a text about Clara Campoamor and now I need to write a short text about some historic figure
8/25/19, 16:13 - Sara: Oh 😌♥
8/25/19, 16:13 - Sara: Have you thought any?
8/25/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet
8/25/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also need a travel anecdote
8/25/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I think I already know what I'm going to write
8/25/19, 16:14 - Sara: You have plenty xD
8/25/19, 16:14 - Sara: Surprise me
8/25/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: How do you say why don't you trust me in Spanish?
8/25/19, 16:14 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
8/25/19, 16:14 - Sara: Do you really want to know it?
8/25/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: ¡Sí!
8/25/19, 16:15 - Sara: 😂
8/25/19, 16:15 - Sara: ¿Por qué no confías en mí?
8/25/19, 16:15 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
8/25/19, 16:17 - Sara: Good luck
8/25/19, 16:24 - Sara: Btw, why do you want to travel in September?
8/25/19, 16:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply as soon as I can
8/25/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can, I'll probably travel later as well
8/25/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cuando estudiaba en la extranjero, yo viajé con mis amigas a Eslovenia. Visitamos un estupendo pueblo llamado Bled. Allí alquilamos un bote. Cuando mi amiga rema a un bote, yo estaba muy nervioso. La me preguntó : "¿Por qué no confías en mí?" y cayó en el bote. Casi nos caemos al agua.
8/25/19, 16:27 - Sara: Nice
8/25/19, 16:27 - Sara: *el extranjero
8/25/19, 16:28 - Sara: Bote is okay but i would say “barco”
8/25/19, 16:28 - Sara: Cuando mi amiga remaba el bote*
8/25/19, 16:29 - Sara: Ella me preguntó*
8/25/19, 16:29 - Sara: Mmmm i would say “y se cayó en el bote”
8/25/19, 16:29 - Sara: Or “dentro del bote”
8/25/19, 16:30 - Sara: As you said it, it has the connotation your friend fell to the boat from another different place
8/25/19, 16:30 - Sara: I hope you want to travel with me 😂
8/25/19, 16:33 - Sara: Really, do you want?
8/25/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, of course, traveling with someone is better for me than traveling alone
8/25/19, 16:37 - Sara: Well... okay
8/25/19, 16:37 - Sara: I don’t know what to do
8/25/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
8/25/19, 16:44 - Sara: Yes, with the trip
8/25/19, 16:44 - Sara: Maybe it is my conception, my mood or whatever
8/25/19, 16:44 - Sara: But i feel used 😂
8/25/19, 16:45 - Sara: Well, i’d use a different word
8/25/19, 16:45 - Sara: But it is like you have found the excuse to travel
8/25/19, 16:46 - Sara: Maybe i overthink
8/25/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: So when someone invites you somewhere you think that they just use you as an excuse to do something?
8/25/19, 17:00 - Sara: No reallu
8/25/19, 17:01 - Sara: Depending
8/25/19, 17:01 - Sara: Obv in plans that are simple or not requires something specific, not
8/25/19, 17:02 - Sara: Sounds weird
8/25/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's basically what you said I am doing
8/25/19, 17:03 - Sara: Because i don’t know what you have in your mind
8/25/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: A trip with a friend to meet more friends, complicated, I know
8/25/19, 17:03 - Sara: Is it that?
8/25/19, 17:04 - Sara: Really?
8/25/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you think it is?
8/25/19, 17:04 - Sara: I don’t know
8/25/19, 17:04 - Sara: Just i cannot figure it out
8/25/19, 17:05 - Sara: The way you are planning it and that stuff... maybe it is like i am there for no reason
8/25/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for actually wanting the trip to somehow work out
8/25/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not a huge fan of making plans on the fly
8/25/19, 17:06 - Sara: Of course i really appreciate it
8/25/19, 17:06 - Sara: I know
8/25/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I proposed a plan, you can propose a different one, or some changes
8/25/19, 17:07 - Sara: I like it
8/25/19, 17:07 - Sara: But again
8/25/19, 17:07 - Sara: I feel to be extra
8/25/19, 17:08 - Sara: I don’t know 😖😖😖
8/25/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't even know what to tell you anymore
8/25/19, 17:08 - Sara: Why?
8/25/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have no clue where all this doubts are coming from
8/25/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: These*
8/25/19, 17:09 - Sara: Insecurities
8/25/19, 17:09 - Sara: Like i don’t know what to think about the situation
8/25/19, 17:09 - Sara: You about me
8/25/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: For now just friends, we're letting things happen, remember?
8/25/19, 17:10 - Sara: I remember
8/25/19, 17:11 - Sara: I don’t want to make thing uncomfortable
8/25/19, 17:12 - Sara: Like idk why i feel like that
8/25/19, 17:12 - Sara: Sorry
8/25/19, 17:13 - Sara: Just confuse me not knowing about you
8/25/19, 17:13 - Sara: And what you are thinking
8/25/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not really thinking much about that right now
8/25/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to figure out my life first
8/25/19, 17:16 - Sara: I know
8/25/19, 17:16 - Sara: Fair enough
8/25/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: By the time of the trip it may be at least partially figured out
8/25/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it should make things easier
8/25/19, 17:16 - Sara: Yes
8/25/19, 17:17 - Sara: But i’m afraid
8/25/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of what?
8/25/19, 17:17 - Sara: Of everything with you
8/25/19, 17:17 - Sara: Like maybe i’m doing too much effort
8/25/19, 17:17 - Sara: Maybe i’m too excited for stuff that is not real
8/25/19, 17:18 - Sara: These days i’ll tell you about the trip
8/25/19, 17:18 - Sara: But yes, i don’t want to interrupt
8/25/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know that either, only time will tell
8/25/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Patience is key
8/25/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You told me before that we are both very impatient
8/25/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm trying to change that
8/25/19, 17:19 - Sara: True
8/25/19, 17:20 - Sara: But i’m the last thing of everything
8/25/19, 17:20 - Sara: And that sucks
8/25/19, 17:21 - Sara: But i understand you
8/25/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not failing my studies and not getting into crippling debt unfortunately takes some priority, sorry
8/25/19, 17:21 - Sara: I know
8/25/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Difficult to think about anything else positively
8/25/19, 17:22 - Sara: Fair enough
8/25/19, 17:23 - Sara: Well, tell me when you want to buy the tickets and i tell you
8/25/19, 17:24 - Sara: I should have given distance since the beginning, but it is unavoidable
8/25/19, 17:24 - Sara: But i’ll try
8/25/19, 17:24 - Sara: Just tell me for the tickets and we buy them togethed
8/25/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already bought the ticket to Milan
8/25/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: The price was going up quickly so I had to
8/25/19, 17:26 - Sara: Okay
8/25/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow I'll try to buy the return ticket
8/25/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will arrive on Sunday evening, if you come on Monday it's going to be fine
8/25/19, 17:27 - Sara: Okay
8/25/19, 17:55 - Sara: One last thing: Just tell me what to do and how to treat you because this is confusing, i’m only finding contradictory feelings. Because spending my money to see a guy who is indifferent towards or hates me makes me doubt.
8/25/19, 17:56 - Sara: I understand your situation but your messages hurted me, tbh
8/25/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I didn't want you to go I wouldn't ask you to, I want you to come with me
8/25/19, 18:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I told you that making any decisions while I'm still overall in a rather negative mood doesn't seem wise to me
8/25/19, 20:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/25/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, I might give that city a second chance but I don't really expect anything from Paris 😑
8/25/19, 21:10 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
8/25/19, 21:10 - Sara: Why not?
8/25/19, 21:11 - Sara: We did not visit even half of ig
8/25/19, 21:11 - Sara: It*
8/25/19, 21:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Too frenchy
8/25/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told Ainara that she is bearable only because she's part spanish
8/25/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that's not even that much better than French 🤣
8/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: But you have said it is better
8/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: Fair enough 😁😁😁😁💕💕💕💕
8/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: Nobody can hate her, she is adorable 🤷🏽‍♀
8/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: Which languages are better?
8/25/19, 21:41 - Sara: (Would you like to play pictionary?)
8/25/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: In 30 minutes, ok?

8/25/19, 22:41 - Sara: But it is picturillo
8/25/19, 22:42 - Sara: But i cannot
8/26/19, 00:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/26/19, 00:48 - Sara: I hope you didn’t get angry
8/26/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, you have other things to do and that's perfectly fine, have fun gordi
8/26/19, 03:38 - Sara: Thanks ♥

8/26/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine, nothing new, still nothing from the ugent office
8/26/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
8/26/19, 14:18 - Sara: I just woken up 😂😁
8/26/19, 14:19 - Sara: So nothing new neither from today
8/26/19, 14:19 - Sara: Will you call?
8/26/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll wait and I'll do it tomorrow
8/26/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last time he answered on Tuesday, I don't want to appear to insistent
8/26/19, 14:20 - Sara: Yes, it is a wise decision
8/26/19, 14:20 - Sara: What are you going to do today?
8/26/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably the same as yesterday and the day before, and the day before that...
8/26/19, 14:21 - Sara: What about your friend?
8/26/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: He told me that he's still busy with his thesis
8/26/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: He should be free around friday
8/26/19, 14:23 - Sara: Well, on Friday you will have plans
8/26/19, 14:23 - Sara: And how is your exam going?
8/26/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, I had some problems with some topics but now I understand them so it's ok
8/26/19, 14:25 - Sara: That is okay ^^ have you studied everything already?
8/26/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, around 60%
8/26/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: By the end of this week I should finish the theory and I'll start doing the exercises, there's quite a lot of them
8/26/19, 14:35 - Sara: Cool 😎
8/26/19, 14:35 - Sara: More than theory?
8/26/19, 14:38 - Sara: You: https://twitter.com/idazten/status/1165756944805715972?s=21
8/26/19, 17:16 - Sara: Even Denmark wants to conquer some part of Poland in Hamlet 🤦🏽‍♀😂
8/26/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: We're so awesome that simply everybody wants a piece
8/26/19, 18:14 - Sara: Nah
8/26/19, 18:15 - Sara: Nobody recognise you as a normal country
8/26/19, 18:15 - Sara: How is it going?
8/26/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked Lorenzo and for Milan we will have accommodation
8/26/19, 19:01 - Sara: 👏🏽 😁😁😁😁
8/26/19, 19:02 - Sara: Nice, where exactly?
8/26/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: In his house, I'm not sure where it is, I'll ask later
8/26/19, 19:02 - Sara: Thanks! ♥
8/26/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just asked for suggestions and he suggested that
8/26/19, 19:03 - Sara: Okay! We can try to find something else or...?
8/26/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now something in Bologna or Florence
8/26/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm talking to one friend in Florence, we'll see
8/26/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although I would like to stay a day or two in Bologna, I don't want to overstay my welcome
8/26/19, 19:05 - Sara: True
8/26/19, 19:05 - Sara: When i asked Thelma she couldn’t
8/26/19, 19:05 - Sara: Neither Mara
8/26/19, 19:07 - Sara: Dis you buy the other ticket?
8/26/19, 19:07 - Sara: Can i do something?
8/26/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet
8/26/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm thinking if we are going to stay in Genoa or just go to Bologna in the evening
8/26/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: For Florence we'll probably have something so we still need accommodation in Bologna and possibly Genoa
8/26/19, 19:17 - Sara: We have thought about staying two days in Milan
8/26/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
8/26/19, 19:17 - Sara: Maybe we can only visit Genoa
8/26/19, 19:21 - Sara: Or what do you think?
8/26/19, 19:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Genoa and then back home? Nah
8/26/19, 19:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/26/19, 19:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: For sure in Bologna
8/26/19, 19:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Genoa, I don't know yet
8/26/19, 19:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends what we will do there
8/26/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: On Wednesday we could go to Genoa, return to Milan in the evening and go to Bologna the next day
8/26/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or go straight from Genoa to Bologna
8/26/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or stay the night in Genoa and go to Bologna the next day
8/26/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure which one I like the most
8/26/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's around 2 hours by train from Milan to Genoa so it's possible
8/26/19, 19:44 - Sara: Mmmmm
8/26/19, 19:45 - Sara: Depending if we have a place to stay
8/26/19, 19:45 - Sara: Maybe it is useless
8/26/19, 19:45 - Sara: Right?
8/26/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, well I don't like it very much
8/26/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: But in Milan we have a place
8/26/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: If we get one in Bologna maybe we can just go there from Genoa
8/26/19, 19:46 - Sara: As well
8/26/19, 19:46 - Sara: Who we can ask more?
8/26/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Enrico told me he will be there but I haven't actually asked about a place to stay
8/26/19, 19:48 - Sara: We can ask
8/26/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, Google cannot find me any way to get to Bologna from Genoa
8/26/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: By train or something, I mean
8/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Weird
8/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Bus?
8/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Maybe it is bar
8/26/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Bologna it's possible to find a reasonable place for around 200 euro for two people
8/26/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You would leave on Sunday, right?
8/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Far*
8/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Monday is cheaper
8/26/19, 19:56 - Sara: But if it is better for you i cannot go back to spain on sunday
8/26/19, 19:56 - Sara: How many days?
8/26/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking from Thursday to Sunday so 3 nights
8/26/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: But one more is not much of an issue
8/26/19, 19:57 - Sara: I can*
8/26/19, 19:57 - Sara: Booking?
8/26/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it doesn't make that much difference
8/26/19, 19:58 - Sara: It is a lot of money right?
8/26/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Trip advisor
8/26/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I still hope we can find something better
8/26/19, 19:59 - Sara: Okay ^^
8/26/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: How much would be fine per night?
8/26/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me, I guess around 50 per night for two is acceptable
8/26/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: On airbnb I see some stuff in that range
8/26/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although probably something cheaper too
8/26/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/38088827?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-19&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566842617_xqt%2F1Z%2BQbP0zC9YB&s=rWUvt6s2
8/26/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing special but pretty cheap
8/26/19, 21:23 - Sara: Yesssss
8/26/19, 21:23 - Sara: Damn
8/26/19, 21:24 - Sara: Maybe it is far fron the centre?
8/26/19, 21:24 - Sara: Idk
8/26/19, 21:24 - Sara: We can ask for opinion
8/26/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, seems reasonable
8/26/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ask the Italians?
8/26/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, no Wi-Fi but I can live with that
8/26/19, 23:08 - Sara: Yep
8/26/19, 23:09 - Sara: I CANNOT BE INSTAGRAMMER D:
8/26/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you want to do that or should I?
8/27/19, 00:43 - Sara: I can ask
8/27/19, 00:43 - Sara: ^^
8/27/19, 00:43 - Sara: Or maybe when i have my computer i can see if it is in a good place
8/27/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, I haven't checked very thoroughly so it would be appreciated
8/27/19, 00:44 - Sara: I will do it
8/27/19, 00:44 - Sara: Everything good?
8/27/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup

8/27/19, 00:45 - Sara: So nice
8/27/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you sure you're not getting back together? 😉
8/27/19, 00:49 - Sara: No, but i’ll tell you what is going on
8/27/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: How's it possible that you have a flood now?
8/27/19, 11:09 - Sara: The storm you mean? 😂
8/27/19, 11:10 - Sara: Yeah, idk, the temperatures went lower
8/27/19, 11:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what you were doing in the evening but I meant in Madrid xd
8/27/19, 11:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, but it's a regular flood in Madrid
8/27/19, 11:10 - Sara: 😂
8/27/19, 11:11 - Sara: And in whole Spain in general
8/27/19, 11:11 - Sara: Idk, summer storms
8/27/19, 11:11 - Sara: It was great
8/27/19, 11:11 - Sara: How are you?
8/27/19, 11:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine, somehow I woke up early, I had a fairly productive morning so it's ok
8/27/19, 11:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
8/27/19, 11:13 - Sara: At what time?
8/27/19, 11:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: 8
8/27/19, 11:13 - Sara: I woke up now, my friends from Madrid are going to visit me 💕
8/27/19, 11:13 - Sara: Damn, too soon
8/27/19, 11:13 - Sara: But that is nice, what have you been doing?
8/27/19, 11:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Studied to my exam, I made some significant progress and also I practiced a bit on the guitar
8/27/19, 11:15 - Sara: In only 3 hours? That is quite good
8/27/19, 11:15 - Sara: Video video video 😌
8/27/19, 11:17 - Sara: Be productive then 😌
8/27/19, 11:17 - Sara: I’ll try to get up and search the stuff from the trip
8/27/19, 11:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you ask Enrico?
8/27/19, 11:19 - Sara: About what exactly?
8/27/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: He told me he will be in Bologna, maybe he can help us with the accommodation
8/27/19, 11:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: If not, airbnb is also fine for me so no pressure
8/27/19, 11:20 - Sara: I will ask to him! 😁😁😁
8/27/19, 11:20 - Sara: I thought u asked already, but i can ^^
8/27/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe also ask Mara how can we get to Bologna from Genoa
8/27/19, 11:26 - Sara: 👍
8/27/19, 11:26 - Sara: Okay, airnb, enrico and mara hahaha
8/27/19, 11:26 - Sara: I hope not to forget
8/27/19, 11:47 - Sara: It tells me that the dates are not available
8/27/19, 11:47 - Sara: only until 19th
8/27/19, 11:49 - Sara: Did you rent it already?
8/27/19, 11:49 - Sara: It is taken from the 20th to 23rd
8/27/19, 11:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, I'll check in a few minutes
8/27/19, 11:50 - Sara: Okay!
8/27/19, 11:56 - Sara: Okay, Mara told me:
8/27/19, 11:58 - Sara: Well...it depends where are you in Milan
8/27/19, 11:58 - Sara: By bus the more economic way is flixbus
8/27/19, 11:58 - Sara: And by train is a bit more expensive but easier to find
8/27/19, 12:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, but I meant from Genoa
8/27/19, 12:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: so we have to go back to Milan?
8/27/19, 12:01 - Sara: Ahhh Bologna xD
8/27/19, 12:01 - Sara: Okay
8/27/19, 12:02 - Sara: And yep, Enri is a little bit busy
8/27/19, 12:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: it also shows me not available, how is it possible that only the exact dates I wanted are taken 😤
8/27/19, 12:02 - Sara: I asked directly if he can let us some space
8/27/19, 12:02 - Sara: But i'm checking other aitnb's
8/27/19, 12:02 - Sara: Are you sure you didm't do anything? :o
8/27/19, 12:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, I was only looking
8/27/19, 12:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, it's pretty hard to book it by mistake
8/27/19, 12:03 - Sara: hahahaha just in case
8/27/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: very weird
8/27/19, 12:04 - Sara: It is possible to cancel in 24 hours before the day you picked
8/27/19, 12:05 - Sara: But yep, this one is not bad https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/32907340?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-20&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566900278_rS42AoqFMz4rgoHJ&s=q-zb-BKS
8/27/19, 12:05 - Sara: Marino Bus
8/27/19, 12:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: one more day I think, from 19th
8/27/19, 12:06 - Sara: Yes (it is a bus station) it’s nearby Brignole train station
8/27/19, 12:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, cool
8/27/19, 12:07 - Sara: D: too expensive xD
8/27/19, 12:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLvohMXgcBo
8/27/19, 12:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/35357401?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-19&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566885585_iV8YHjQCjV3u0J61&s=c0TKOpQo
8/27/19, 12:08 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8MO7fkZc5o
8/27/19, 12:09 - Sara: Seems nice, should we do something?
8/27/19, 12:10 - Sara: how can you see cheaper flats?
8/27/19, 12:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: if it's ok we should probably book it
8/27/19, 12:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just set the price lower
8/27/19, 12:10 - Sara: Who should do it?
8/27/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: can you do it? If not, I can but I will have to borrow some money from my parents
8/27/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: not a problem, so your choice
8/27/19, 12:11 - Sara: They have a cat
8/27/19, 12:11 - Sara: At the moment you do not have to pay
8/27/19, 12:12 - Sara: Oh, I have to pay 79 euros now
8/27/19, 12:12 - Sara: Sure that you want to rent it now?
8/27/19, 12:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: it is possible to cancel it if necessary, right?
8/27/19, 12:13 - Sara: I'll check it again
8/27/19, 12:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, maybe Enrico will help but at the same time, I don't want it to happen the same thing as with the first one
8/27/19, 12:14 - Sara: true
8/27/19, 12:15 - Sara: yep, until 18th september
8/27/19, 12:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I guess it makes sense to book it
8/27/19, 12:16 - Sara: 19th-23rd right?
8/27/19, 12:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: you want to leave on monday, right?
8/27/19, 12:17 - Sara: if possible, yes
8/27/19, 12:17 - Sara: well, if we have any problem with that, i'm sure we can change it right?
8/27/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: on 18th we are in Genoa and we should arrive in Bologna on 19th, I think
8/27/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure
8/27/19, 12:18 - Sara: mmmm
8/27/19, 12:18 - Sara: 16-17 milan
8/27/19, 12:18 - Sara: 18-19 Genoa
8/27/19, 12:18 - Sara: And the rest in Bologna?
8/27/19, 12:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess so, from Bologna to Florence and whatever else around
8/27/19, 12:19 - Sara: Will we stay in Florence?
8/27/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's close enough to Bologna that it doesn't make sense
8/27/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: especially if you take the flight from Bologna
8/27/19, 12:20 - Sara: and what about you?
8/27/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, me too actually
8/27/19, 12:20 - Sara: aaah haha okay
8/27/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: but my flight is on wednesday
8/27/19, 12:21 - Sara: So i rent it? I have to do it now
8/27/19, 12:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I talked to my friend in Florence and I will stay in his place until the return
8/27/19, 12:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you can and want, yes
8/27/19, 12:21 - Sara: 👌🏻
8/27/19, 12:22 - Sara: Okay!
8/27/19, 12:22 - Sara: If we can cancel it, it is okay
8/27/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, great
8/27/19, 12:23 - Sara: Wait
8/27/19, 12:23 - Sara: It is not an apartment
8/27/19, 12:23 - Sara: but like a dorms?
8/27/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: does it matter?
8/27/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: we had some good experience with dorms
8/27/19, 12:24 - Sara: Shared bathroom, nothing else
8/27/19, 12:24 - Sara: hahahaha true
8/27/19, 12:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: we're not going to spend a lot of time there anyway
8/27/19, 12:26 - Sara: As well
8/27/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: we'll see, we can cancel it so no problem
8/27/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll keep looking for something else but I'll worry less if I have something already
8/27/19, 12:27 - Sara: okay!
8/27/19, 12:27 - Sara: okay, done
8/27/19, 12:28 - Sara: I'll have to receive an email with an answer from the host
8/27/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, great
8/27/19, 12:28 - Sara: Like, the reservation is not done already
8/27/19, 12:28 - Sara: I suppose the host has to accept us :)
8/27/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: so now only thing left is how to travel between the cities
8/27/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: but that shouldn't be much of a problem
8/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: From Milan to Genova and from Genoa to Bologna we have it
8/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: Mara told me
8/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: have you bought both tickets then?
8/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: I hope to do it soon D:
8/27/19, 12:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, I couldn't wait, the prices kept going up
8/27/19, 12:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already paid like almost 20 euro more and I waited like 1 or 2 days
8/27/19, 12:30 - Sara: Damn
8/27/19, 12:30 - Sara: Okay ^^
8/27/19, 12:30 - Sara: I'll talk with my parents these days
8/27/19, 19:52 - Sara: ?????
8/27/19, 19:52 - Sara: The host said she cannot give ua the room
8/27/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: What???
8/27/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Any reason?
8/27/19, 19:53 - Sara: It is in italian, one second
8/27/19, 19:53 - Sara: Maybe only two days
8/27/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which ones?
8/27/19, 19:54 - Sara: She has struggles at that time, maybe two days
8/27/19, 19:54 - Sara: I can ask
8/27/19, 19:54 - Sara: And Enri cannot neither
8/27/19, 19:55 - Sara: I’ll try to search more places
8/27/19, 19:56 - Sara: How are you?
8/27/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, since I woke up early I finished most of the stuff I wanted to do early
8/27/19, 19:57 - Sara: Good!
8/27/19, 19:57 - Sara: What are you doing now?
8/27/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I started looking for another place
8/27/19, 19:58 - Sara: Me too
8/27/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm also looking in Florence
8/27/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/11080898?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-19&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566928805_hhUYV%2Fw3cgD9kKvA&s=0ohc3RmK
8/27/19, 20:06 - Sara: What do you think is better?
8/27/19, 20:06 - Sara: sleeping in florence or bologna?
8/27/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure, tbh
8/27/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think Florence is nicer
8/27/19, 20:07 - Sara: Seems reasonable
8/27/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: but in Bologna we have more friends
8/27/19, 20:07 - Sara: But idk why i don't like sharing with more people, it can be weird xD
8/27/19, 20:07 - Sara: true
8/27/19, 20:07 - Sara: Prices are nicer in Florence, i see
8/27/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess either city is fine
8/27/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: also Florence is much closer to Genoa
8/27/19, 20:08 - Sara: Yep
8/27/19, 20:08 - Sara: Depending on the days this girls says, we can stay 2 days in bologne and other two in Florence
8/27/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought about that
8/27/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can also ask two other friends in Florence
8/27/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll do that
8/27/19, 20:09 - Sara: Okay!
8/27/19, 20:09 - Sara: I'll answer you asap about everything
8/27/19, 20:11 - Sara: https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/21675279?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-19&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566929405_8cx2JoSuWQ3lSQyB
8/27/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: 'Dream room' xd
8/27/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: looks nice
8/27/19, 20:12 - Sara: And it is horrible hahaha
8/27/19, 20:12 - Sara: yep, not bad
8/27/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: owner is very proud of the bed xd
8/27/19, 20:13 - Sara: hahahah
8/27/19, 20:13 - Sara: and idk why xD
8/27/19, 20:14 - Sara: are you okay? :)
8/27/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, a little sad about the accommodation but fine
8/27/19, 20:15 - Sara: Why? because she rejected?
8/27/19, 20:15 - Sara: well, it sucks, i hope we can find something
8/27/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I guess the dream room is acceptable
8/27/19, 20:16 - Sara: 😂
8/27/19, 20:16 - Sara: And the other one as well
8/27/19, 20:16 - Sara: Maybe better location?
8/27/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: it seems that most of the places can be cancelled until some time in september so just in case we should book something today
8/27/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: and wait for what that woman from Bologna says
8/27/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: and my friends
8/27/19, 20:18 - Sara: Mmmm it is okay for us staying in Florence when we have to take the flight in Bolognia?
8/27/19, 20:18 - Sara: I’m afraid
8/27/19, 20:18 - Sara: “Especially” if i’m alons xd
8/27/19, 20:18 - Sara: Alone xD
8/27/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: at what time would you have the flight?
8/27/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, I will go with you, I'm staying until wednesday
8/27/19, 20:19 - Sara: If it is the same as i checked yesterday, arouns 6 pm
8/27/19, 20:20 - Sara: 😌♥
8/27/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: then I don't think it will be much of a problem to get to the airport from Florence
8/27/19, 20:20 - Sara: Well, everything is about checking the connections
8/27/19, 20:21 - Sara: But agree
8/27/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will ask my friends about that as well
8/27/19, 20:21 - Sara: So, should i book?
8/27/19, 20:21 - Sara: Yes 😌
8/27/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: which one?
8/27/19, 20:21 - Sara: And airport in Florence?
8/27/19, 20:21 - Sara: Well, you booked your flight
8/27/19, 20:22 - Sara: I will compare
8/27/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it's reasonable
8/27/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think they flew from Pisa but I'm not sure
8/27/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can always cancel so we don't really lose anything if we do
8/27/19, 20:23 - Sara: Of course
8/27/19, 20:23 - Sara: And maybe change dates
8/27/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: in a few days we will have more information and for now I will feel better having something just in case
8/27/19, 20:24 - Sara: okay
8/27/19, 20:24 - Sara: the one you send is nearer from the centre
8/27/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.airbnb.es/rooms/36925531?adults=2&check_in=2019-09-19&check_out=2019-09-23&source_impression_id=p3_1566929677_8wwFKGyjIz%2BKky4X&s=pzjTQEnY
8/27/19, 20:25 - Sara: like, 20-30 minutes by foot. The other one seems further
8/27/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: in Bologna?
8/27/19, 20:26 - Sara: Florence, i'm talking about florence now
8/27/19, 20:27 - Sara: Seems nice
8/27/19, 20:27 - Sara: And it is near the centre
8/27/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: yup, seems nice
8/27/19, 20:28 - Sara: should we book it?
8/27/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: and it's flexible, we can cancel until 18th
8/27/19, 20:28 - Sara: perfect
8/27/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, I don't see anything significantly cheaper or in better location
8/27/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: we will see, I have an idea now, I'll see what my friends tell me
8/27/19, 20:29 - Sara: so?
8/27/19, 20:29 - Sara: tell me :)
8/27/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: if we could go from Genoa to Florence, stay there like two days and then go to Bologna for the rest of the time it could be quite nice
8/27/19, 20:30 - Sara: yep :P
8/27/19, 20:30 - Sara: We can book one for Florence and then the one from Bologna
8/27/19, 20:30 - Sara: or idk if your friends would be available
8/27/19, 20:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should probably know tomorrow
8/27/19, 20:31 - Sara: but being able of cancelling it...
8/27/19, 20:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: we can book that one in Bologna, worst case we will just change it or cancel
8/27/19, 20:31 - Sara: okay, the whole week?
8/27/19, 20:31 - Sara: wait, i want to check something
8/27/19, 20:32 - Sara: 2 nights?
8/27/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: more or less, but for now we can book in Bologna from 19th to 23rd I guess, just in case if it doesn't work out
8/27/19, 20:33 - Sara: sure?
8/27/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you think?
8/27/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: we can cancel it, right?
8/27/19, 20:33 - Sara: i was trying to see if it is cheaper staying Florence+Bologna or rather only one
8/27/19, 20:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, we can try to book that way too, if you want
8/27/19, 20:34 - Sara: 167 in totall
8/27/19, 20:35 - Sara: well, it is some couple of euros
8/27/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: so similar price
8/27/19, 20:35 - Sara: yes
8/27/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, fine for me
8/27/19, 20:35 - Sara: so?
8/27/19, 20:35 - Sara: what do you think it is better?
8/27/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, Iike staying two days in Florence and then the rest in Bologna
8/27/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like*
8/27/19, 20:36 - Sara: but...
8/27/19, 20:36 - Sara: i'm thinking
8/27/19, 20:36 - Sara: okay, i check this
8/27/19, 20:37 - Sara: because it is confusing
8/27/19, 20:38 - Sara: distrubution would be like 16-17 Milan, 18-19 florence and 19-23 in bologna?
8/27/19, 20:38 - Sara: 😩😩😩
8/27/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: 18 is Genoa, no?
8/27/19, 20:38 - Sara: but for sleeping i mean
8/27/19, 20:38 - Sara: do we have a place to stay there?
8/27/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still not sure what are we going to do there, we will be with Mara and Nicco and I don't think we will leave early
8/27/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to check when is the latest train or something to Florence
8/27/19, 20:40 - Sara: okay, i'll try to find it as well
8/27/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: best case I will ask my friend in Florence and we can stay there
8/27/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: one of my friends already told me it's fine but he told me he leaves a bit far
8/27/19, 20:42 - Sara: 2:50 by bus
8/27/19, 20:42 - Sara: is it possible to us to access to the city easily?
8/27/19, 20:42 - Sara: https://www.thetrainline.com/book/results?journeySearchType=single&origin=df3c3ad8f1bc1f031c838ee26bcd4028&destination=94440f0d5ead8875b6e22402f53e5b83&outwardDate=2019-08-27T20%3A00%3A00&outwardDateType=departAfter&inwardDateType=departAfter&selectedTab=train&selectExactTime=true&lang=en&dpiCookieId=ZOGZEAJ6BVWN76ZFARKF5Y72O&selectedOutward=Ta%2BU%2Ba2kkd4%3D%3AnLmrP9q%2Bcfs%3D%3AStandard

8/27/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: tomorrow I will know more
8/27/19, 20:43 - Sara: okay
8/27/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I would like to book something anyway, if it's not a problem
8/27/19, 20:43 - Sara: okay, everything in bologne...?
8/27/19, 20:43 - Sara: but we can have this in mind
8/27/19, 20:44 - Sara: it is confusing hahaha
8/27/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: wait, one of my friends is writing to me already
8/27/19, 20:44 - Sara: okaaaay
8/27/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: um, ok so Arturo unfortunately doesn;t have space although he will try to look for something
8/27/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: My other two friends haven't responded yet, probably tomorrow
8/27/19, 21:10 - Sara: Okayy
8/27/19, 21:10 - Sara: 👌🏻
8/27/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: so, do we book it for now or not?
8/27/19, 21:10 - Sara: So?

8/27/19, 21:13 - Sara: Wait
8/27/19, 21:13 - Sara: I’m afraid of not being able to visit bologna properly
8/27/19, 21:13 - Sara: Like idk the time
8/27/19, 21:14 - Sara: Wait
8/27/19, 21:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, the city is not particularly big

8/27/19, 21:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: The one that didn't accept was cheaper, right?
8/27/19, 21:34 - Sara: He denied
8/27/19, 21:34 - Sara: Which one?
8/27/19, 21:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: one we tried booking earlier
8/27/19, 21:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: another one? damn

8/27/19, 21:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/27/19, 21:36 - Sara: Maybe not profitable for only two days...?
8/27/19, 21:36 - Sara: Maybe i can ask him, but he did not say any reason
8/27/19, 21:36 - Sara: Maybe because i’m young or whatever?
8/27/19, 21:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, it's strange
8/27/19, 21:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: strange city xd
8/27/19, 21:37 - Sara: Agree

8/27/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: nothing will beat Utrecht anyway
8/27/19, 21:40 - Sara: Sadly
8/27/19, 21:40 - Sara: But we can make it similar haha
8/27/19, 21:40 - Sara: **Sara brings lights**

8/28/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: so my friend unfortunately lives quite far
8/28/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: so airbnb is probably a better option
8/28/19, 13:25 - Sara: The other girl who rejected us the first says if is better for us to find another place, but we have it 😁
8/28/19, 13:26 - Sara: Seems so

8/28/19, 14:26 - Sara: Thank god
8/28/19, 14:26 - Sara: Hahahhaha
8/28/19, 14:28 - Sara: I was thinking that it has to be unconfortable that if i had penis it would bs visible everytime i’m excited
8/28/19, 14:28 - Sara: That is harsh
8/28/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, you just have to assert dominance and be proud of it
8/28/19, 14:30 - Sara: Patriarchy, are you there? 😂
8/28/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Self-confidence 💪
8/28/19, 14:31 - Sara: As well
8/28/19, 14:31 - Sara: But why dominance? XD
8/28/19, 14:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just a meme I saw a few times

8/28/19, 15:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, great, no time to waste 👌
8/28/19, 15:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not carrying you xd
8/28/19, 15:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is your knee?

8/28/19, 15:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems good, it's been almost 3 weeks so it should be almost fine now
8/28/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Does it still hurt or something?
8/28/19, 15:59 - Sara: A lit bit, but because my leg has been without weight for weeks
8/28/19, 15:59 - Sara: It is okay
8/28/19, 15:59 - Sara: And exercising it again makes it been tired
8/28/19, 16:02 - Sara: Prices increased and hours changed :)
8/28/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not surprised
8/28/19, 16:02 - Sara: 😂
8/28/19, 16:02 - Sara: I’ll ask

8/28/19, 16:12 - Sara: If you arrive at 7...

8/28/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just remember that it's always an option
8/28/19, 16:12 - Sara: Of course
8/28/19, 16:13 - Sara: I’ll check another places
8/28/19, 16:13 - Sara: Because it is the same price for me goinf on sunday and on monday so
8/28/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can ask Lorenzo to pick you up or you can just do something on your own and wait for me
8/28/19, 16:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 16:14 - Sara: I’ll keep checking
8/28/19, 16:15 - Sara: I don’t want to arrive too early and too late
8/28/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: The one you mentioned before, around 5pm seems fine
8/28/19, 16:16 - Sara: It is not bad
8/28/19, 16:20 - Sara: I’m so nervious 😣😣
8/28/19, 16:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/28/19, 16:21 - Sara: Idk
8/28/19, 16:21 - Sara: I don’t want to fuck it up
8/28/19, 16:21 - Sara: Or idk if it is okay
8/28/19, 16:21 - Sara: You know me 😂
8/28/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: The trip?
8/28/19, 16:30 - Sara: Yes, or me buying the tickets
8/28/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is there to screw up?
8/28/19, 16:30 - Sara: Or maybe losing some hours of class,m
8/28/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok
8/28/19, 16:30 - Sara: But i want to do the trip
8/28/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your choice
8/28/19, 16:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 16:31 - Sara: Hahaha
8/28/19, 16:31 - Sara: My choice?
8/28/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: To go or not
8/28/19, 16:32 - Sara: I get nervious easily with this stuff 😖
8/28/19, 16:33 - Sara: I’ll relax a lit
8/28/19, 16:33 - Sara: I tell you
8/28/19, 16:59 - Sara: Is it everything okay?
8/28/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
8/28/19, 17:00 - Sara: Okay
8/28/19, 17:01 - Sara: Seemed different
8/28/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shaved mood 🙃
8/28/19, 17:13 - Sara: Nice
8/28/19, 17:13 - Sara: How do you feel?
8/28/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still lazy
8/28/19, 17:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to start doing something
8/28/19, 17:14 - Sara: You should
8/28/19, 17:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you?
8/28/19, 17:15 - Sara: I’m a little bit sad
8/28/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/28/19, 17:16 - Sara: Because ‪I’m still afraid of me not being part of the trio to Italy and, ergo, you not caring if you want to see me or not when, in my case, that is one of the important things I have on mind.‬ Just I feel weird.
8/28/19, 17:16 - Sara: Also i’m dealing with some jealousy and with stress, so i can only think in that
8/28/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jealousy?
8/28/19, 17:17 - Sara: Envy probably, idk
8/28/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to see you and I want both of us to enjoy the trip
8/28/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of what?
8/28/19, 17:18 - Sara: Sure?
8/28/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, sure
8/28/19, 17:18 - Sara: Of stuff
8/28/19, 17:18 - Sara: Like not important, maybe it is a topic to talk later
8/28/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so probably never, your choice
8/28/19, 17:19 - Sara: Why so you say that?
8/28/19, 17:19 - Sara: Why are you rude?
8/28/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't mean to be rude, it's just that most likely we'll just forget about it
8/28/19, 17:20 - Sara: Seems rude anyway
8/28/19, 17:21 - Sara: It is something i will forget, believe me
8/28/19, 17:21 - Sara: I wanted to talk about that but you didn’t want to, and neither is something you should think now
8/28/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not?
8/28/19, 17:22 - Sara: Why not to what?
8/28/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not anymore, why I shouldn't think about it?
8/28/19, 17:23 - Sara: You told be it was not your business and because you have more things in mind that what i do or i don’t
8/28/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel like talking about something, feel free, I'm not going to force you
8/28/19, 17:24 - Sara: When your situation is better
8/28/19, 17:24 - Sara: Thanks anyway
8/28/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is already actually
8/28/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: In a few days, maybe even tomorrow I should sort out the paperwork
8/28/19, 17:26 - Sara: That is really nice 🤗
8/28/19, 17:26 - Sara: Idk maybe i’m too altered for everything
8/28/19, 17:26 - Sara: I am afraid of not being understood  😂
8/28/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely not if you don't say anything
8/28/19, 17:27 - Sara: 😂
8/28/19, 17:27 - Sara: Fair enough
8/28/19, 17:28 - Sara: So idk, feelings of losing someone or being tricked are sometimes there when you have a sort of relation with one person who was another sort of relation
8/28/19, 17:29 - Sara: I’m okay in that sort of situation but i have to face emotions and learn from them
8/28/19, 17:30 - Sara: And maybe if someone knows about this, that someone would feel bad or whatever, or just indifference or ignorance
8/28/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you talking about me or Guada?
8/28/19, 17:30 - Sara: Guada
8/28/19, 17:30 - Sara: You
8/28/19, 17:31 - Sara: + When i want to have the same relation as always
8/28/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mentioned that it's by no means easy for me
8/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: I know
8/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: Everything is about dealing with feelings
8/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: And yes, i’m afraid of the trip for that
8/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: Because i want and i’m frightened at the same time
8/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: Well, uncertainty
8/28/19, 17:34 - Sara: And i do not want one situation causes problems to the other one
8/28/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: One day I asked you if you are getting back together and you said you will explain later
8/28/19, 17:34 - Sara: We are not a couple
8/28/19, 17:35 - Sara: But we are getting closer
8/28/19, 17:35 - Sara: Exactly as we feel like
8/28/19, 17:35 - Sara: And i’m happy for that because he is a person who i want to keep in my life
8/28/19, 17:36 - Sara: But it does not mean i do not want anything with you, any kind of thing
8/28/19, 17:36 - Sara: Like keeping you informed makes me feel okay, because i do not want to hide or lie to anybody
8/28/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you can do whatever you want, you know that, if you want to tell me about it, sure, if you don't feel like, that's also fine, you don't really owe me anything
8/28/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you are happy, everything is fine
8/28/19, 17:39 - Sara: It’s now about owing you something, i know
8/28/19, 17:40 - Sara: But it is about having you always in mind, and with everything which that means
8/28/19, 17:40 - Sara: And you?
8/28/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm better but I still have a lot to figure out
8/28/19, 17:41 - Sara: I know
8/28/19, 17:41 - Sara: But i feel that there are things with no answers
8/28/19, 17:41 - Sara: Yet?
8/28/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot, I suppose
8/28/19, 17:42 - Sara: I don’t want to fuck everything up
8/28/19, 17:42 - Sara: This is difficult, i supoose
8/28/19, 17:42 - Sara: Suppose*
8/28/19, 17:43 - Sara: I’m afraid of being judged or misunderstood 😔
8/28/19, 17:45 - Sara: And not knowing what will happen...
8/28/19, 17:45 - Sara: But i’m sure that everything is about time
8/28/19, 17:47 - Sara: Like idk if the effort i’m doing for people is reciprocate, worth
8/28/19, 17:48 - Sara: Maybe now i’m too overwhelmed for everything and i should trust people and myself
8/28/19, 17:48 - Sara: Idk, sorry for talking a lot
8/28/19, 17:48 - Sara: You can do you daily stuff
8/28/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so too
8/28/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: For all these questions, I suppose
8/28/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just wait and see
8/28/19, 17:51 - Sara: See you*
8/28/19, 17:51 - Sara: I think it can be useful
8/28/19, 17:51 - Sara: And necessary
8/28/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you buy the tickets?
8/28/19, 17:52 - Sara: Not yet, but i should
8/28/19, 17:52 - Sara: I’ll check now
8/28/19, 17:52 - Sara: I’m involving my parents without purpose and that makes me feel bad
8/28/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Involving in what?
8/28/19, 17:53 - Sara: Like they say they can take me to the airport or bring some uni stuff to Madrid (because it is easiee for us to go directly to the airport without going to the city centre)
8/28/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I have some stuff to do, I'll talk to you later
8/28/19, 17:54 - Sara: Do not worry, it is okay
8/28/19, 18:08 - Sara: Omfg omfg 😂
8/28/19, 18:08 - Sara: I have just bought them 🤗
8/28/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: What times?
8/28/19, 18:11 - Sara: To milan 15th at 14:45-16:50
8/28/19, 18:11 - Sara: And to madrid again from bolognia 23rd at 17:15
8/28/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, nice
8/28/19, 18:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 18:12 - Sara: I’m like this
8/28/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are going to see  a lot of new places and meet friends from Ghent, focus on that
8/28/19, 18:13 - Sara: I know
8/28/19, 18:13 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 18:14 - Sara: It is going to be so nice
8/28/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, we're going to Italy
8/28/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice
8/28/19, 18:16 - Sara: Not France? 😣😣😣😣😢😢😢😢
8/28/19, 18:16 - Sara: I’m so happy audbeidnrimeodnekdndkkdd
8/28/19, 18:16 - Sara: Of not going to France, of course
8/28/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't die
8/28/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yet
8/28/19, 18:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
8/28/19, 18:18 - Sara: After the trip
8/28/19, 18:18 - Sara: 😂
8/28/19, 18:18 - Sara: Do you have more newsv
8/28/19, 18:18 - Sara: ?
8/28/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
8/28/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing else happened
8/28/19, 18:40 - Sara: Okay, you tell me if there are 😁
8/28/19, 19:40 - Sara: Sorry for before, Kamil. I was like kind of nervious because 1) when i buy this kind of things is unavoidable 2) i don’t know what you think about me ir everythinf or how it is going to be the treatment
8/28/19, 19:41 - Sara: Or maybe the implication that this trip supposes to me is quite big, like... is it going to determine oir situation? Yours? Mine?
8/28/19, 19:41 - Sara: Are we going to be okay and uncomfortable? Or just in tension?
8/28/19, 19:42 - Sara: Like i don’t know how to approach you, especially in person, in which mood
8/28/19, 19:42 - Sara: Shaved or unshaved
8/28/19, 19:43 - Sara: I don’t want to repeat something similar to Pula or Ljubljana
8/28/19, 19:43 - Sara: I needed to say this, i prefer being honest with me and you when something concerns me like this
8/28/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how is it going to be but for sure not like that, at least I'll do my best so that it's not
8/28/19, 19:44 - Sara: I will do it as well
8/28/19, 19:45 - Sara: But it is inevitable that i want to hug you and to be physically closer (maybe now?)
8/28/19, 19:45 - Sara: And ahhh 🙈🙈🙈
8/28/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean 'maybe now'?
8/28/19, 19:50 - Sara: I don’t think i can change my mind so fast
8/28/19, 19:50 - Sara: But maybe after some weeks or because of the situation i don’t do it
8/28/19, 19:51 - Sara: I won’t be a... how is the name xd
8/28/19, 19:51 - Sara: Abuser?
8/28/19, 19:51 - Sara: Like i respect others in this sense
8/28/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I get the point but I'm not sure how that answered my question?
8/28/19, 19:53 - Sara: Because i want to be closer now
8/28/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Aaah, ok
8/28/19, 19:54 - Sara: 😂
8/28/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, no one understands spanish
8/28/19, 19:54 - Sara: So that is what on my mind
8/28/19, 19:54 - Sara: Why?

8/28/19, 19:59 - Sara: I’m too shy to make things clearer

8/30/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
8/30/19, 12:47 - Sara: The same but 5 minutes ago haha
8/30/19, 12:48 - Sara: What did you do yesterday?
8/30/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just the standard stuff and I finished watching Dark on netflix
8/30/19, 12:49 - Sara: Really? That fast?
8/30/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it was just 8 episodes
8/30/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: What did you do?
8/30/19, 12:50 - Sara: Hunt sadness 😂
8/30/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You were looking for sad people to have sex with? Well, you're so kind 😋
8/30/19, 12:53 - Sara: Always xd
8/30/19, 12:53 - Sara: I get horny with tears
8/30/19, 12:54 - Sara: Nah, i was sad
8/30/19, 12:54 - Sara: But as always xd
8/30/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
8/30/19, 13:42 - Sara: Why not?
8/30/19, 13:42 - Sara: Nah, dealing with feelings
8/30/19, 13:43 - Sara: I try to be okay and use my coping mechanisms when Guada is with his girls and yesterday it did not work
8/30/19, 13:43 - Sara: Everything was uncomfortable 😂
8/30/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess you care too much but it's understandable, I suppose
8/30/19, 13:48 - Sara: Why?
8/30/19, 13:48 - Sara: Like idk, we have a kind of relation and everything is okay unless he is with her
8/30/19, 13:48 - Sara: And i feel ignored or that he has lied 🤷🏽‍♀
8/30/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: You say that you don't want to be back together but that's not really what this situation tells me to be honest
8/30/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you talk about it with him?
8/30/19, 13:49 - Sara: Yes
8/30/19, 13:50 - Sara: I don’t want to be a couple
8/30/19, 13:50 - Sara: But it is normal to feel like this as well, especially when things are not 100% clear
8/30/19, 13:50 - Sara: We were him, her and me in the seam team in the bowling, i felt so akward...
8/30/19, 13:51 - Sara: And i try to talk but i feel i interrupt
8/30/19, 13:51 - Sara: They are not neither a couple but, again, i feel like a piece of shit 🤷🏽‍♀ nothing new haha
8/30/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Amazing, everyone seems to be in relationships and you all seem afraid to just call them relationships
8/30/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if you say air doesn't exist it doesn't make it true that it doesn't exist
8/30/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: You, him or whoever, I mean
8/30/19, 13:53 - Sara: What makes a relationship?
8/30/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not sure but in Ghent we pretended for quite a long time that we were not in one and it didn't really influence the feelings in any way
8/30/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was lying to myself back then, basically
8/30/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you sure you're not doing the same now?
8/30/19, 13:55 - Sara: Lying to myself? I don’t feel it
8/30/19, 13:55 - Sara: I am just saying that i want to be treated as an equal
8/30/19, 13:55 - Sara: Ans not to be so shy
8/30/19, 13:56 - Sara: Feelings are there, but with all people i have relation
8/30/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, if someone has a partner or 'sort of partner' if they don't want to called it what it is, obviously they're going to give more attention to that person than to others
8/30/19, 13:57 - Sara: But i’m the same situation with him as he has with her
8/30/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that what he thinks?
8/30/19, 13:58 - Sara: Like again, what makes a relationship?
8/30/19, 13:58 - Sara: It is what i see and i feel, and we discussed
8/30/19, 13:58 - Sara: Like, i think the problem is that we do not know how to react
8/30/19, 13:58 - Sara: Me with Raquel, he with you
8/30/19, 13:59 - Sara: Because it is a new situation
8/30/19, 13:59 - Sara: Talking about having this kind of vision of this situation
8/30/19, 14:00 - Sara: And normally we are great, alone or with other friends, but when he is with her or i talk about you, things can be less comfortable
8/30/19, 14:01 - Sara: Again, something i have to learn. I’m very insecure, much more in new situations
8/30/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you if you say so
8/30/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope it works out for you
8/30/19, 14:02 - Sara: I hope too
8/30/19, 14:02 - Sara: Everything is about time
8/30/19, 14:02 - Sara: You must be like wtf
8/30/19, 14:03 - Sara: What are you doing?
8/30/19, 14:04 - Sara: Btw, your view and opinion are important for me
8/30/19, 14:05 - Sara: And idk, i am afraid of my relation with you
8/30/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was going to do something useful but the vet is going to arrive soon to vaccinate my dogs so I need yo wait
8/30/19, 14:05 - Sara: At what time?
8/30/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe in around 30 minutes
8/30/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe less
8/30/19, 14:06 - Sara: Okay, not too much time
8/30/19, 14:06 - Sara: But yes
8/30/19, 14:06 - Sara: Idk, what do you think?
8/30/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Complex situation that I know only from what you tell me
8/30/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot of things you say that actions and things that happen don't seem to match
8/30/19, 14:08 - Sara: Tell me
8/30/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you already, no couples, but clearly there are couples or at least desires to be in them
8/30/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Awkward situations, a lot of feelings, everything just so tangled
8/30/19, 14:10 - Sara: No couples, no desire. Just be myself with people.
8/30/19, 14:11 - Sara: Yes, it is something i have to work. I mean feelings. In all situations i am afraid of reactions and i overthink
8/30/19, 14:11 - Sara: And be treated as a normal person and reciprocate if it is possible
8/30/19, 14:14 - Sara: But as it can happen with friendships, or whatever
8/30/19, 14:14 - Sara: I’m afraid of losing people i care, and i act weird
8/30/19, 14:16 - Sara: Seems strange but i think it happens with you and with him recently
8/30/19, 14:24 - Sara: I feel ridiculous with you as well😣
8/30/19, 14:30 - Sara: What am i doing bad with you? With him? Not able to handle properly feelings?
8/30/19, 14:36 - Sara: Like i get confused bc people are not direct
8/30/19, 14:41 - Sara: If people reject me or accept me at once, everything would be easier
8/30/19, 14:41 - Sara: But i have to be careful  because idk what people think about me
8/30/19, 14:42 - Sara: Idk if they lie to me, and that sucks
8/30/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe he is pushed away because of me and I am pushed away because of him
8/30/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps stop mentioning me in your conversations and it might get better between you two, idk
8/30/19, 15:21 - Sara: Ignoring reality is okay?
8/30/19, 15:22 - Sara: But i meant that i act weird with you, more careful
8/30/19, 15:27 - Sara: Because i thought that but you, her, still exist
8/30/19, 15:33 - Sara: Well, what are you going to do now?
8/30/19, 15:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mean do, like study or something or do with you?
8/30/19, 15:34 - Sara: Well, i meant the first
8/30/19, 15:34 - Sara: But now i’m curious
8/30/19, 15:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still waiting for the vet, he's late
8/30/19, 15:35 - Sara: One hour? :o
8/30/19, 15:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: As for the second, I'm still not sure, I guess I'll wait for the trip
8/30/19, 15:36 - Sara: Okay, it is reasonabls
8/30/19, 16:38 - Sara: Btw, today is Enrico’s birthday :€
8/30/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: He's getting old too

8/30/19, 17:15 - Sara: Yep, it is like that
8/30/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's 'more like make you desperate', but ok, point taken
8/30/19, 17:16 - Sara: 😂
8/30/19, 17:17 - Sara: If you feel like doing something, you can tell me

8/30/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not so much, first I had to wait for the vet and in the end he never arrived, then I had to try to fix my cousin's computer
8/30/19, 21:04 - Sara: Really? Was it today?
8/30/19, 21:05 - Sara: Never trust someone who has to come to your house for business stuff 😂
8/30/19, 21:05 - Sara: What happened to the computer?
8/30/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's just shitty, it was working very slowly, I installed a new operating system that really doesn't require much and it still works like crap
8/30/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some cheap, Chinese laptop so I'm not particularly surprised
8/30/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I guess it was worth a try

8/31/19, 20:46 - Sara: I hope is not happening the same as in the bowling
8/31/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehhh, you said you don't want to be a couple again but you get upset when you're not treated like when you would be in one, it's a bit confusing
8/31/19, 21:10 - Sara: Why do you say that now?
8/31/19, 21:11 - Sara: I want him to talk to me and not ignoring me xd
8/31/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: You just mentioned that situation in the bowling
8/31/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I remember correctly his new 'totally not girlfriend' got very upset about you and blocked him everywhere once
8/31/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Caution is advised
8/31/19, 21:12 - Sara: Because he did not tell me when we were suppose to trust the other
8/31/19, 21:13 - Sara: Kamil, don’t put shit now please
8/31/19, 21:13 - Sara: Past is past
8/31/19, 21:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, not a good moment
8/31/19, 21:14 - Sara: For what?
8/31/19, 21:16 - Sara: Why am i a dramatic when i want to be treated like...a person?
8/31/19, 21:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I just tried to put things into perspective to understand the reasons for what's happening
8/31/19, 21:17 - Sara: It is okay
8/31/19, 21:18 - Sara: Do not worry
8/31/19, 21:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then again, what do I know, close to nothing, so I'm not really very well qualified for that
8/31/19, 21:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry
8/31/19, 21:18 - Sara: Again
8/31/19, 21:18 - Sara: It is okay
8/31/19, 21:19 - Sara: But i do not like when people talk
Without knowing
8/31/19, 21:19 - Sara: But i guess you are out of the context, physically talking
8/31/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll just shut up, your life is none of my business so I just shouldn't, sorry
8/31/19, 21:21 - Sara: No
8/31/19, 21:21 - Sara: Man
8/31/19, 21:21 - Sara: You are part of my life
8/31/19, 21:22 - Sara: And you can give pieces of advise
8/31/19, 21:22 - Sara: But i don’t want you to hurt me

9/1/19, 14:13 - Sara: Not a baby anymore :B
9/1/19, 14:13 - Sara: Orgasms are not the best in life
9/1/19, 14:14 - Sara: But one of the best thing, not lie
9/1/19, 14:14 - Sara: How is it going?
9/1/19, 14:21 - Sara: Is it okay?
9/1/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, garage construction continues
9/1/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you?
9/1/19, 15:02 - Sara: I hope you end soon and you can have your own car there 🌝
9/1/19, 15:02 - Sara: I’m good... just thinking
9/1/19, 15:03 - Sara: Like, i’m tired of making efforts for people to care about me
9/1/19, 15:03 - Sara: And i don’t know if that people really care about me
9/1/19, 15:03 - Sara: It is just... feeling that i’m forcing everything
9/1/19, 15:11 - Sara: Why do i think it is my responsibility people loving me, in some way?
9/1/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: This one is actually for my brother's
9/1/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's I suppose mostly about trust, I don't know if there is any way to convince yourself that they do without trust
9/1/19, 15:37 - Sara: Mmmmm
9/1/19, 15:37 - Sara: I understand it
9/1/19, 15:37 - Sara: But there is a moment that people do not do anything for you
9/1/19, 15:37 - Sara: Or mess up with you
9/1/19, 15:38 - Sara: People think i’m going to be there for them forever even when they treat me like shit
9/1/19, 15:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, are you talking about me or in general?
9/1/19, 15:39 - Sara: Is that important?
9/1/19, 15:39 - Sara: I mean, maybe i have seen it in you and Guada
9/1/19, 15:39 - Sara: I’m not going to lie
9/1/19, 15:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: About myself I can talk, about everyone else, I won't
9/1/19, 15:40 - Sara: But I want to see everything in Italy, and that makes me feel better
9/1/19, 15:40 - Sara: Less anxious
9/1/19, 15:43 - Sara: And I know you have your issues and life and i won’t force you, of course
9/1/19, 15:43 - Sara: But i won’t force myself neither
9/1/19, 15:56 - Sara: But why is it hard for people to say yes or nov
9/1/19, 15:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Letting things go is difficult, nothing suprising
9/1/19, 15:58 - Sara: Yes but
9/1/19, 15:59 - Sara: I don’t lie when people i care lie to me
9/1/19, 15:59 - Sara: It is like
9/1/19, 15:59 - Sara: If you don’t give a shit, just tell it. I do not understand people
9/1/19, 15:59 - Sara: 🤷🏽‍♀
9/1/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fallout after breakup is hard to handle and it's even harder when good memories are still quite fresh
9/1/19, 16:02 - Sara: I know, i know it is about time
9/1/19, 16:02 - Sara: But...
9/1/19, 16:02 - Sara: This message was deleted
9/1/19, 16:04 - Sara: I feel like i fucked it up
9/1/19, 16:04 - Sara: And everything will changs
9/1/19, 16:06 - Sara: What i meant with all of this it is that i’m tired of forcing people to care about me because in the past used to or because i still care
9/1/19, 16:07 - Sara: That is it, it is not about blaming your healing
9/1/19, 16:07 - Sara: The opposite
9/1/19, 16:08 - Sara: But i don’t know what is good or right anymore, if i’m forcing you to talk or what
9/1/19, 16:09 - Sara: But you talked to me, made me happy
9/1/19, 16:12 - Sara: Sorry for this
9/1/19, 16:14 - Sara: I understand that you do not want to talk, that is okay. I see it
9/1/19, 16:16 - Sara: It can hurt, it still hurts
9/1/19, 16:17 - Sara: I will talk to you in case i know more info about the trip
9/1/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can talk about stuff, just not about relationships and feelings
9/1/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't mind discussing some topics or whatever, just friendly conversations

9/1/19, 16:22 - Sara: What are you doing?
9/1/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit of a break now, but still working on the garage
9/1/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Esn is organizing an international picnic on the last day my esn card is valid
9/1/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have to go
9/1/19, 16:24 - Sara: 18th september?
9/1/19, 16:24 - Sara: Yes please!
9/1/19, 16:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 16:25 - Sara: Can i ask why?
9/1/19, 16:28 - Sara: It is been ¿80 years? since German invasion
9/1/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, there are some events happening now
9/1/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Trump was supposed to visit but he went to play golf
9/1/19, 16:30 - Sara: 😂
9/1/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's probably better, I don't really want that asshole here
9/1/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's shitty enough as it is
9/1/19, 16:30 - Sara: I have just seen also a straight prise parade in usa, i want to throw up
9/1/19, 16:31 - Sara: And please, if you don’t want to answer questions. Just tell me, do not ignore me. Feels like hell 😇
9/1/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, sorry
9/1/19, 16:32 - Sara: Thanks
9/1/19, 16:32 - Sara: That is a no, I suppose
9/1/19, 16:32 - Sara: But it is a minimum of education
9/1/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: These guys are assholes, I agree, but this whole concept of being proud of your sexuality, whatever it is, seems odd to me
9/1/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, is being straight, gay, bi or whatever really something so important?
9/1/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like some sort of achievement?
9/1/19, 16:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: It just is what it is, it feels like sometimes sexuality is a defining quality of a person
9/1/19, 16:39 - Sara: 🤦🏽‍♀
9/1/19, 16:39 - Sara: I understand your point
9/1/19, 16:40 - Sara: But you don’t get the main idea of “prise”
9/1/19, 16:40 - Sara: Pride*
9/1/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: In this case I suppose it's because they are being oppressed by the conservative part of society
9/1/19, 16:40 - Sara: If we live in a non-discriminatory society, it would not care
9/1/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess maybe it feels so odd to me because I already think in that way
9/1/19, 16:41 - Sara: Not always conservative
9/1/19, 16:41 - Sara: And that is okay
9/1/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: If someone is great, awful or whatever their sexuality doesn't matter at all to me
9/1/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really understand why it should matter, idk
9/1/19, 16:43 - Sara: Me neither 🤷🏽‍♀
9/1/19, 16:43 - Sara: Ignorance that supposes fear
9/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: Someone should be proud of being black, woman, lgbt... because we are discriminated
9/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: And raped, killed, bullied for that 🤗
9/1/19, 16:44 - Sara: And visibility is the key
9/1/19, 16:45 - Sara: Should you be claiming equality when you are a privileged a cis white rich man?
9/1/19, 16:45 - Sara: Useless
9/1/19, 16:45 - Sara: And in that parade, they were using homophobic propaganda
9/1/19, 16:46 - Sara: They were not reven eally claiming it
9/1/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't misunderstand me, I do not support them
9/1/19, 16:46 - Sara: I know
9/1/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: They made an asshole pride parade
9/1/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I suppose you can be proud of that too, why not xd
9/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: I think pride is not really pride
9/1/19, 16:47 - Sara: I think it is more activism
9/1/19, 16:48 - Sara: When they do LGBT pride in Madrid with party, with politics parties as PP or Ciudadanos (against everything) and alcohol, that is not pride
9/1/19, 16:48 - Sara: My sister heard in a bus “do you want to go to the parade? But without being with those fucking faggots”
9/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: Or for me it is not totally a pride the 8th of March when i have seen people discriminating trans women or guys claiming attention
9/1/19, 16:49 - Sara: So idk, for me it is about education and visibility
9/1/19, 16:50 - Sara: Daily routine, not once a year
9/1/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's just that name threw me off a little bit, it doesn't really fit what it really is
9/1/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pride means something else to me
9/1/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's not really important, it's just a name
9/1/19, 16:50 - Sara: But maybe i am proud of being woman and bi because i’m not ashamed of that
9/1/19, 16:51 - Sara: It is important when they treat you like shit for being that
9/1/19, 16:51 - Sara: When they catcall you or you hear in tv that a guy does
Not want to go out with a bi girl because it is abouf “competence”
9/1/19, 16:51 - Sara: 🙃
9/1/19, 16:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: The activism is important, the way you call it not so much, that's what I meant
9/1/19, 16:52 - Sara: Is a name a problem?
9/1/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
9/1/19, 16:52 - Sara: So?
9/1/19, 16:53 - Sara: I think pride is only for LGBT matters
9/1/19, 16:54 - Sara: When you have been discriminated for X matter, it is okay to claim your own space
9/1/19, 16:54 - Sara: And rights
9/1/19, 16:56 - Sara: That is my view
9/1/19, 16:56 - Sara: And also when i have been in feminist and LGBT concentrations i felt safe, understood, supported
9/1/19, 16:57 - Sara: Sometimes seeing that other people has lived the same as you and you are not a weirdo, is givinf a good step
9/1/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wasn't talking about if it's good or not, it is good
9/1/19, 16:58 - Sara: When you have everything in life and you are accepted, the oy thing you do with these things is discriminating more and showing privilege
9/1/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I only meant that for me it's a rather foreign concept being proud of something you were born with
9/1/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not proud of my nationality, gender, sexuality or whatever
9/1/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I understand your point, I wasn't discriminated for any of these things
9/1/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: So for me they simply don't feel like anything to be proud of
9/1/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: But for someone who was I guess they can
9/1/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough
9/1/19, 17:01 - Sara: I understand
9/1/19, 17:01 - Sara: Yes, that it is
9/1/19, 17:01 - Sara: You are a cis white man 😂
9/1/19, 17:01 - Sara: Straight as well
9/1/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Basically the devil
9/1/19, 17:01 - Sara: Nationality is another topic, i think
9/1/19, 17:02 - Sara: Not really
9/1/19, 17:02 - Sara: But socially and politically talking, they have all privileges that some people lack of
9/1/19, 17:02 - Sara: I would not date devils 😂
9/1/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shame, I want to be like lucifer 😥
9/1/19, 17:03 - Sara: 😂😂😂
9/1/19, 17:03 - Sara: Be a devil then
9/1/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: But Lucifer is in another level, I’m sure
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: Hahaha cute
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: But yes, idk
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: I really like and hate at the same time talking about this topics
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: They can be complex
9/1/19, 17:04 - Sara: Ans i feel exposed
9/1/19, 17:06 - Sara: How do you see it?
9/1/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my perfect world nobody would give a fuck about gender, sexuality or whatever
9/1/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I guess I kind of already think that way
9/1/19, 17:07 - Sara: That would be as well mine
9/1/19, 17:07 - Sara: Maybe without gender 😂
9/1/19, 17:07 - Sara: But i wish it could be like that
9/1/19, 17:07 - Sara: I hope it is possible to change but... hard
9/1/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why without?
9/1/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't want to be equal?
9/1/19, 17:08 - Sara: Why do i want to remove gender?
9/1/19, 17:08 - Sara: Mmmmm
9/1/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not remove
9/1/19, 17:08 - Sara: I want to remove it 😂
9/1/19, 17:08 - Sara: But that is after feminism succeed
9/1/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just not take it into account when thinking about people
9/1/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, oh she is shit because she's a woman or something of that sort
9/1/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just she is shit because of her personality or something
9/1/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or he, or whatever
9/1/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just an example
9/1/19, 17:09 - Sara: Yes yes
9/1/19, 17:10 - Sara: And that is why gender removal
9/1/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess in some way gender would still be there, people would still be straight, gay or whatever
9/1/19, 17:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:20 - Sara: Too complex i know xD
9/1/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless everyone would become bisexual I think at least in that way gender will stay
9/1/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And in my opinion that's fine
9/1/19, 17:24 - Sara: Why? 🤔
9/1/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you choose your sexuality?
9/1/19, 17:24 - Sara: Nop
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: But gender is social
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: Sexuality not
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: It is biological
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: Gender was used for determing what it for boys and for girls
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: Aka gender roles
9/1/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, fine, than I'm going to say that I'm attracted to people with vagina
9/1/19, 17:25 - Sara: No...?
9/1/19, 17:26 - Sara: If you are attracted to genitals, it is a problem
9/1/19, 17:26 - Sara: And well, bisexuality?
9/1/19, 17:27 - Sara: Idk, it is my opinion and reflections
9/1/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in that case I don't think it's something one can choose
9/1/19, 17:28 - Sara: Gender? No and yes
9/1/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sexual attraction
9/1/19, 17:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know, if sexual attraction is influenced by social norms, than I guess, if it's biological then it's probably going to stay
9/1/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really have a problem with that, if we would all be equal and just have freedom to choose
9/1/19, 17:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that is what I mentioned before about not caring about sexuality and gender, everything should be simply accepted
9/1/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your choice, your free will, no judgment
9/1/19, 17:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, but I'm talking about my perfect world, not this shitty one
9/1/19, 17:41 - Sara: Of course of course
9/1/19, 17:41 - Sara: I know
9/1/19, 17:41 - Sara: I wish i could live in that world
9/1/19, 17:42 - Sara: But analysis is needed as well
9/1/19, 17:42 - Sara: And with that analysis i hope we can be nearer
9/1/19, 17:43 - Sara: Btw https://twitter.com/sevynseas/status/1168157893515984896?s=21 💕
9/1/19, 17:44 - Sara: I think a lot about Carlos when i hear it 😂
9/1/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hue Hue, my brother is going to school tomorrow 👌
9/1/19, 17:46 - Sara: Really? That soon?
9/1/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, university begins in October but everything before that at the beginning of September
9/1/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is it in Spain?
9/1/19, 17:47 - Sara: That late?
9/1/19, 17:48 - Sara: Well
9/1/19, 17:48 - Sara: Depending
9/1/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, and the semester ends in february
9/1/19, 17:48 - Sara: But normally it is in the 2nd week of september
9/1/19, 17:48 - Sara: Both uni and schools
9/1/19, 17:48 - Sara: My uni used to start late, as you
9/1/19, 17:49 - Sara: But now we end first semester exams on january
9/1/19, 17:51 - Sara: How is your exam?
9/1/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, I hope to finish the theory tomorrow and start doing exercises
9/1/19, 17:52 - Sara: Cool
9/1/19, 17:52 - Sara: And are you in your garage stuff?
9/1/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at the moment, my father is still working but he doesn't need my help for now
9/1/19, 17:53 - Sara: What are you exactly doing?
9/1/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Holding things, drilling, bringing stuff, simply helping assemble the garage
9/1/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing particularly complicated
9/1/19, 18:01 - Sara: Well, it is something at least
9/1/19, 18:01 - Sara: And what are you doing?
9/1/19, 18:03 - Sara: 😎 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O81XldQHApg
9/1/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some of my stuff, I didn't have time before because of the garage
9/1/19, 18:27 - Sara: Cool
9/1/19, 18:28 - Sara: I’m finally taking my things from ghe box I sent from Ghent
9/1/19, 18:28 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
9/1/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: The world is ending
9/1/19, 18:28 - Sara: 😂😂
9/1/19, 18:28 - Sara: I mean
9/1/19, 18:29 - Sara: It’s winter clothes haha
9/1/19, 18:29 - Sara: We will wash them and then I can take some to Madrid
9/1/19, 18:29 - Sara: But idk, normally i’m not doing that much
9/1/19, 18:30 - Sara: Idk if i should force myself to do productive stuff
9/1/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably, I do that and over time it becomes easier to be productive
9/1/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm also planting trees
9/1/19, 18:31 - Sara: But i don’t know what
9/1/19, 18:31 - Sara: Good ecologist 🤗
9/1/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once I do that I don't want to kill my tree so I keep going
9/1/19, 18:32 - Sara: Well, virtual trees 🤦🏽‍♀
9/1/19, 18:32 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
9/1/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Figure out something you would like to learn
9/1/19, 18:32 - Sara: But in 3 weeks I start uni so idk
9/1/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to play the guitar, learn Spanish and programming
9/1/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can also pick something for yourself
9/1/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: And starting uni doesn't really interfere
9/1/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: You might just have to organize your time better
9/1/19, 18:33 - Sara: I don’t feel like doing anything
9/1/19, 18:33 - Sara: At least productive
9/1/19, 18:33 - Sara: That worries me
9/1/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Start learning italian
9/1/19, 18:34 - Sara: I started but for what
9/1/19, 18:34 - Sara: I mean, i can understand more or less and for one week
9/1/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Knowing more languages is always a good thing
9/1/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Never a waste of time
9/1/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not just for the trip
9/1/19, 18:36 - Sara: True but idk
9/1/19, 18:36 - Sara: I don’t have anything in mind
9/1/19, 18:36 - Sara: Maybe drums but xd
9/1/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, maybe a new instrument?
9/1/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or dancing classes?
9/1/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or singing classes?
9/1/19, 18:37 - Sara: I thought about that, maybe after I start classes and after being there some some weeks
9/1/19, 18:37 - Sara: Going to a psychologist is a good option 😂
9/1/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whatever you want, just think of something that you always wanted to be able to do
9/1/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it was the guitar for example
9/1/19, 18:38 - Sara: I would like to, if i’m honest
9/1/19, 18:38 - Sara: But i don’t find any aim
9/1/19, 18:38 - Sara: I’m lost... again

9/1/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can ask
9/1/19, 18:48 - Sara: No, it is okay 🤗
9/1/19, 18:48 - Sara: I don’t know limits
9/1/19, 18:49 - Sara: You have stuff to do and me saying shit is not useful 😂
9/1/19, 18:53 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 19:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: New makeup? Very nice, suits you
9/1/19, 19:33 - Sara: Since 1998
9/1/19, 19:34 - Sara: Suits with my personal life and personality
9/1/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Payasa loca 🤡
9/1/19, 19:34 - Sara: Y gordita
9/1/19, 19:35 - Sara: Nah, this situation overcomes me a lot sometimes
9/1/19, 19:36 - Sara: Well, you know 😂
9/1/19, 19:36 - Sara: How are you?
9/1/19, 19:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Behind the schedule because of the garage 😋
9/1/19, 19:38 - Sara: What do you mean?
9/1/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, still plenty of stuff that I want to do and it's getting kind of late
9/1/19, 19:39 - Sara: You have time, i’m sure
9/1/19, 19:40 - Sara: Btw, just tell me anything, i don’teant to be a bother
9/1/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, don't worry
9/1/19, 19:46 - Sara: What should i do?
9/1/19, 19:48 - Sara: Maybe i’m panicking xz
9/1/19, 19:48 - Sara: XD
9/1/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/1/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, at the moment I'm a bit busy

9/1/19, 19:53 - Sara: This message was deleted
9/1/19, 19:58 - Sara: Okay, I should think first and then write 😂
9/1/19, 19:58 - Sara: Do not worry 🤗
9/1/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: So many deleted messages 😬
9/1/19, 19:59 - Sara: Only two 😂
9/1/19, 19:59 - Sara: But yes
9/1/19, 20:00 - Sara: I don’t sometimes how to act
9/1/19, 20:00 - Sara: But it is about... letting go? Being indifference and do not give a fuck?
9/1/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, lately I told you that I'm not a part of your life anymore, you said that it's not true but to be honest I've been feeling like just a spectator pretty much since you left Ghent
9/1/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not anybody's fault, it is what it is
9/1/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Long distance I suppose
9/1/19, 20:04 - Sara: But i’m the one who always wants to talk
9/1/19, 20:04 - Sara: Why spectator?
9/1/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really have any role in it, I just see the events when you tell me about them
9/1/19, 20:05 - Sara: You don’t want to be part of my life and you don’t let me part of yours, right?
9/1/19, 20:05 - Sara: That is about living far
9/1/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I told you that I don't blame anybody for that
9/1/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's not really about not wanting, more about not being able to
9/1/19, 20:07 - Sara: And I try to add you in my life
9/1/19, 20:07 - Sara: But I also feel this
9/1/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have many doubts, that's true
9/1/19, 20:08 - Sara: I know it
9/1/19, 20:08 - Sara: But it is like
9/1/19, 20:08 - Sara: Be direct with me
9/1/19, 20:09 - Sara: Again, what kills me is putting effort on people that maybe is not reciprocate
9/1/19, 20:09 - Sara: And yes, the answer will be found in Italy
9/1/19, 20:11 - Sara: But in whatsapp, should i wait him to talk to me or should i be the first one? Does he want to know about me? That kind of stuff
9/1/19, 20:11 - Sara: In my mind I want people to “come to me”, because i’m tired of killing myself for people habing me in their minds
9/1/19, 20:12 - Sara: But then they will forget me and i’ll be the responsible for me
9/1/19, 20:12 - Sara: It*
9/1/19, 20:12 - Sara: It is a dilemma, because i am this kind of people who wants to solve things talking and being direct
9/1/19, 20:12 - Sara: But a relation is not about only one person
9/1/19, 20:14 - Sara: Sometimes i want to give up, but then i’d be alone 😂
9/1/19, 20:17 - Sara: But at the aame time is like... if people do not want me in their life, even if i love them, i’m not going to push them
9/1/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is quite far from the straightforward, easy situation so I have no clue what to do and what I should do
9/1/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just focus on things that I actually can do something about like my exam
9/1/19, 20:21 - Sara: Up to you
9/1/19, 20:21 - Sara: You decide
9/1/19, 20:22 - Sara: I don’t want to annoy or interrupt you
9/1/19, 20:22 - Sara: I like talking with you and that stuff you know, but i’m fed up of forcing everything and feeling like that
9/1/19, 20:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUaLnDL3f-M
9/1/19, 20:30 - Sara: I understand you
9/1/19, 20:32 - Sara: Just let it be and we will see in Italy
9/1/19, 20:33 - Sara: Because it was be 2 months and a half since we saw last time
9/1/19, 20:33 - Sara: One since we broke up
9/1/19, 20:34 - Sara: And i’m sure seeing the other will be the key
9/1/19, 20:34 - Sara: I hope everything is alright for both of us
9/1/19, 20:34 - Sara: I don’t want anything less for you
9/1/19, 20:35 - Sara: Also it is work, i think
9/1/19, 20:35 - Sara: But again, focus now on your exam
9/1/19, 20:36 - Sara: But at the same time i want to talk with you and not feeling like a stalker or something
9/1/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that we can, just not about relationships and feelings
9/1/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: like before about pride for example
9/1/19, 20:38 - Sara: True
9/1/19, 20:38 - Sara: Not able to know why, right?
9/1/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to focus on the exam and feel relatively stable, I don't want to dig into that
9/1/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: not now
9/1/19, 20:39 - Sara: Okay, I understand
9/1/19, 20:39 - Sara: Sorry
9/1/19, 20:40 - Sara: I’ll try to get used to this
9/1/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's basically what we would be doing if we resolved all the issues so I guess it should be healthy for both of us
9/1/19, 20:44 - Sara: Okay
9/1/19, 20:44 - Sara: We can wait for that
9/1/19, 20:45 - Sara: I’ll send memes meanwhile 😂
9/1/19, 20:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: pretty much, memes are life
9/1/19, 20:46 - Sara: But i don’t have reddit :(
9/1/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: you don't need an account to browse it
9/1/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have it
9/1/19, 20:47 - Sara: Not really? I thought so
9/1/19, 20:47 - Sara: But you have the alp
9/1/19, 20:47 - Sara: App*
9/1/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, but it works in browser too
9/1/19, 20:47 - Sara: Excellent 😇
9/1/19, 20:47 - Sara: I’ll download it then
9/1/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: some people post nudes on reddit
9/1/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: so maybe you would like that xd
9/1/19, 20:49 - Sara: Yayyy 😂
9/1/19, 20:49 - Sara: But i prefer sending them 😂
9/1/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: you can post yours
9/1/19, 20:49 - Sara: Or seeing nudes for people i’m interested in 😂
9/1/19, 20:50 - Sara: Not empowering at all haha
9/1/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: r/aww is the one for you
9/1/19, 20:51 - Sara: Cute animals, right? 😂
9/2/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

9/2/19, 03:00 - Sara: Are you okay?
9/2/19, 03:02 - Sara: And sorry about deleting messages, like i don’t want to be regarded as a loser 😂

9/2/19, 11:47 - Sara: And in case i didn’t send it to you 😂 https://youtu.be/neRhGoW3Kbc
9/2/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Partially, they speak pretty fast and there are no subtitles so it's a bit difficult
9/2/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why did you send this?
9/2/19, 13:02 - Sara: I’ll explain it later ^^
9/2/19, 13:02 - Sara: I thought you liked Czec Republic
9/2/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do, just asking if there was any particular reason
9/2/19, 13:04 - Sara: For that reason ^^
9/2/19, 13:04 - Sara: In case you want to go there again 🤗
9/2/19, 13:04 - Sara: Everything okay?

9/2/19, 18:39 - Sara: Is he old?
9/2/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, 5 years
9/2/19, 18:40 - Sara: I hope he is okay
9/2/19, 18:40 - Sara: Maybe some virus
9/2/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

9/2/19, 20:49 - Sara: Why did you remember that?
9/2/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking for something in my conversations and this was the last thing written in fucking complainers one
9/2/19, 20:51 - Sara: Ay

9/3/19, 15:31 - Sara: I’m sure ^^
9/3/19, 15:31 - Sara: What about after vet?
9/3/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: How do I learn what human meat tastes like?
9/3/19, 15:34 - Sara: Helping my parents in their old age
9/3/19, 15:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's slightly more reasonable
9/3/19, 15:44 - Sara: Spain is different
9/3/19, 15:44 - Sara: Can vegans eat human meat?
9/3/19, 15:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: So the answer to both of our questions in Spain would be to eat your parents?
9/3/19, 15:45 - Sara: Mmmm delicious
9/3/19, 15:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 15:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Literally eating pussy

9/3/19, 15:53 - Sara: Then you say i’m the one ugh
9/3/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me? You want to eat your parents, I just want to help mine
9/3/19, 16:00 - Sara: I want to eat people
9/3/19, 16:00 - Sara: Not especifically my parents
9/3/19, 16:00 - Sara: 😇
9/3/19, 16:04 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/3/19, 16:04 - Sara: I think it is about Shakespearian Henry V
9/3/19, 16:08 - Sara: I have read opposite opinions about it so idk if it is good or not
9/3/19, 17:53 - Sara: Btw, for languages what is better? Create a long list and then start memorizing or little by little?
9/3/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm doing little by little
9/3/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have an app called memrise
9/3/19, 18:27 - Sara: Nice
9/3/19, 18:27 - Sara: I was using babble and i’m writing down the expressions and all the stuff in a notebook
9/3/19, 18:27 - Sara: I’ll see
9/3/19, 18:28 - Sara: I’ll try as well
9/3/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm using memrise and busuu
9/3/19, 18:28 - Sara: Why two?
9/3/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Memrise is practically only vocab
9/3/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Busuu has some vocab but mostly grammar
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: Nice
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: I like babble because it is quite varied
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: Idk, seems nice
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: I’ll go little by little
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: How is your day going,
9/3/19, 18:29 - Sara: ?
9/3/19, 18:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I did most of the things, now I have only studying for the exam left
9/3/19, 18:31 - Sara: Niceee
9/3/19, 18:31 - Sara: I was with some italian and doing exercise, mainly
9/3/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool, how's your knee?
9/3/19, 18:32 - Sara: I think it is better, as always
9/3/19, 18:32 - Sara: I’m not using crutches anymore
9/3/19, 18:33 - Sara: Maybe i cannot bend my knee yet at 100%
9/3/19, 18:33 - Sara: Or stairs can be “””painful”””
9/3/19, 18:33 - Sara: But i’m quite nice
9/3/19, 18:34 - Sara: In 5 days, it will be one month ago
9/3/19, 18:34 - Sara: Time passes so fast 😔
9/3/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: In this case that's good, I suppose
9/3/19, 18:38 - Sara: Mmmm yes and no

9/4/19, 12:41 - Sara: Cristina told us in Galicia there is  a statue of a penis
9/4/19, 12:41 - Sara: So similar
9/4/19, 12:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you really just compare Iron man to a penis?
9/4/19, 12:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Blocked*
9/4/19, 12:42 - Sara: 😂
9/4/19, 12:42 - Sara: I’ll try to find cool statues in Spain

9/4/19, 12:47 - Sara: Maravilloso
9/4/19, 12:47 - Sara: No es Iron Man, verdad?
9/4/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Horroroso 😬
9/4/19, 12:49 - Sara: Siempre 🌝
9/4/19, 12:49 - Sara: Qué tal?

9/4/19, 12:50 - Sara: Por qué más o menos?
9/4/19, 12:51 - Sara: Sabes algo de tu universidad?
9/4/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: They finally put all my grades in the transcript of records but they still haven't sent it to my uni
9/4/19, 12:52 - Sara: That is a good sign, right?
9/4/19, 12:52 - Sara: Maybe you can send it to your uni
9/4/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, it has to be official, with a stamp and signature
9/4/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully soon they will
9/4/19, 12:53 - Sara: Ask for it
9/4/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I sent many emails
9/4/19, 12:53 - Sara: I had to do it when i arrived to Spain
9/4/19, 12:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: According to the ugent website, the guy responsible for that stuff should be in the office today from 2pm
9/4/19, 12:54 - Sara: So for tomorrow you will have it for sure, i hope
9/4/19, 12:54 - Sara: Idk, in my uni i had to send the transcript
9/4/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my office they told me that they only accept the documents sent by ugent
9/4/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess every uni does it in their own way
9/4/19, 12:55 - Sara: That is weird but okay, for security
9/4/19, 12:55 - Sara: Or resend it...?
9/4/19, 12:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you are Spanish, similarly like Italians you deserve all the bad things that happen, but me? Solo soy un pobre polaco, no lo merezco.

9/4/19, 13:20 - Sara: I don’t annoy then 😀
9/4/19, 15:14 - Sara: http://www.unica-network.eu/page/internships-unica-secretariat (this is useful for you?)
9/4/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, doesn't look like my field
9/4/19, 15:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really even engineering, I think
9/4/19, 15:41 - Sara: Yes, i know
9/4/19, 15:41 - Sara: But maybe in that website there are more?
9/4/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It seems that they offer only what you sent me
9/4/19, 15:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thanks anyway 😊
9/4/19, 15:42 - Sara: Welcome? 😂🤷🏽‍♀
9/4/19, 15:43 - Sara: I’ll try to find other stuff
9/4/19, 15:44 - Sara: How is it going?
9/4/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ugent office finally sent my transcript of records
9/4/19, 16:10 - Sara: Yayy
9/4/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: But they forgot to send the document about the changes to the learning agreement...
9/4/19, 16:10 - Sara: So...?
9/4/19, 16:11 - Sara: In the transcript of records you have the old courses?
9/4/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: New ones but I also need a special document with all the changes listed
9/4/19, 16:12 - Sara: True
9/4/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dean of my faculty needs to accept it
9/4/19, 16:12 - Sara: The leaning agreement, basically
9/4/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much
9/4/19, 16:12 - Sara: But you should have it with you, i think
9/4/19, 16:12 - Sara: At least in my case
9/4/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already got it before, that guy sent it to me, but now there was a change again
9/4/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I need a new one
9/4/19, 16:13 - Sara: True, fair enough
9/4/19, 16:13 - Sara: Did you ask for it?
9/4/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
9/4/19, 16:15 - Sara: I hope you have it this week
9/4/19, 16:15 - Sara: And if you have it, is everything solved and you can present your thesis?
9/4/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, he already sent it 😊
9/4/19, 16:17 - Sara: 👏🏽
9/4/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, tomorrow I'll go to uni and try to submit everything
9/4/19, 16:19 - Sara: Nice ☺☺
9/4/19, 16:19 - Sara: Is everything corrent in the papers?
9/4/19, 16:24 - Sara: One of the highschools i have applied for my internship wants to see me this Friday ♥
9/4/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems so
9/4/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice
9/4/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara the teacher

9/4/19, 16:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Try not to have sex with your students xd
9/4/19, 16:26 - Sara: Maaaan
9/4/19, 16:27 - Sara: Why do you see me like a sexual predator? 😂
9/4/19, 16:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 16:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/4/19, 16:29 - Sara: I only see a geek 😂
9/4/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, there is quite a lot of news about such teachers so it's not really uncommon, I guess xd
9/4/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you wanted to eat your parents
9/4/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing will surprise me anymore
9/4/19, 16:30 - Sara: A cannibal pedophile teacher
9/4/19, 16:30 - Sara: My dream 💕
9/4/19, 16:30 - Sara: I’m the combination of the worst thing ever
9/4/19, 16:30 - Sara: Oh, wait
9/4/19, 16:30 - Sara: And catholic
9/4/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: So pedophile, you already mentioned that
9/4/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: No need to repeat
9/4/19, 17:02 - Sara: 😂
9/4/19, 17:02 - Sara: Fair enough
9/4/19, 17:02 - Sara: Yes😌
9/4/19, 17:02 - Sara: What are u doing?
9/4/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was playing some basketball, now I'll rest a few minutes and probably study something
9/4/19, 17:03 - Sara: Cool
9/4/19, 17:03 - Sara: With your brother?
9/4/19, 17:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
9/4/19, 17:04 - Sara: That is nice
9/4/19, 17:04 - Sara: Probably i’ll study italian or download music or documentaries for the flights 😂
9/4/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: How's your Italian?
9/4/19, 17:06 - Sara: If I had
9/4/19, 17:06 - Sara: XD
9/4/19, 17:07 - Sara: I started yesterday to note things, i have not started to memorize stuff
9/4/19, 17:07 - Sara: But seems easy
9/4/19, 17:07 - Sara: Some conjugations are harder
9/4/19, 17:07 - Sara: And yours now?
9/4/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not trying to remember it at the moment because I'm learning spanish
9/4/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was confusing to do both at the same time
9/4/19, 17:08 - Sara: Yes, that is true
9/4/19, 17:09 - Sara: That sometimes can confuse
9/4/19, 17:09 - Sara: Especially in your case
9/4/19, 17:09 - Sara: At the moment i’ll study what can be useful for the trip
9/4/19, 17:10 - Sara: Io vorrei bere qualcosa
9/4/19, 17:10 - Sara: 😂
9/4/19, 17:10 - Sara: Vino rosso 😂
9/4/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Molto bene

9/4/19, 18:32 - Sara: Literally
9/4/19, 18:32 - Sara: Btw, are you still writing your thesis?
9/4/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, it will take me some time, maybe I'll finish next month
9/4/19, 18:34 - Sara: Oh true, that you do not have a specific deadline
9/4/19, 18:34 - Sara: That is nice, little by little
9/4/19, 18:34 - Sara: Do you have clearer what it is going to be about?
9/4/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, with all the other problems I wasn't very motivated to work on it
9/4/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: And my polish promoter had his vacations or something
9/4/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow I'm going to the uni with my papers, I'll check if he's there now
9/4/19, 18:37 - Sara: True, now you are more focused on the exam
9/4/19, 18:37 - Sara: Perfect
9/4/19, 18:37 - Sara: Well, little by little
9/4/19, 19:59 - Sara: Little bitchy perv, you have to pay me :p
9/4/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: For what?
9/4/19, 19:59 - Sara: Airnb

9/4/19, 20:01 - Sara: Not now now
9/4/19, 20:01 - Sara: But i have paid 100% the apartment in Florence
9/4/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now that I have the papers I hope to get the rest of my Erasmus scholarship, as soon as I do, I'll send you the money
9/4/19, 20:02 - Sara: Excellent :B
9/4/19, 20:02 - Sara: Nah, don’t be in a hurry
9/4/19, 20:02 - Sara: Just to remind you 😘
9/4/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please don't tell your father to send his men to collect the money 😫😨
9/4/19, 20:04 - Sara: I will 🥰
9/4/19, 20:04 - Sara: 😈
9/4/19, 20:04 - Sara: Too many marvel films on netflix, cool 😎
9/4/19, 20:05 - Sara: Should i finish thor ragnarok? XD
9/4/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: For sure
9/4/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Valkyrie is lesbian
9/4/19, 20:06 - Sara: Oh really? ♥
9/4/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí
9/4/19, 20:06 - Sara: And do you think i will like something only because there is any LGBT character or something?
9/4/19, 20:06 - Sara: Because you are right
9/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: Nah, i’ll see
9/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: It draws my attention but c’mone
9/4/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope not
9/4/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I thought it could interest you
9/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: And it does
9/4/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: They didn't really show it in the movie, I think
9/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: But is there a film about her? Vecause i thought it was on the way
9/4/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the new one, Thor: love and thunder, it's going to be shown clearly
9/4/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope, at least not yet
9/4/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: She first appeared in Thor ragnarok
9/4/19, 20:08 - Sara: Btw, if you’d like to watch something in netflix tell me and i can dowload it
9/4/19, 20:09 - Sara: True, the one in the dump right?
9/4/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
9/4/19, 20:09 - Sara: Nice 😌
9/4/19, 20:10 - Sara: So i’ll see what i download for, at least, the flights 😂
9/4/19, 20:10 - Sara: Something you want to recommend?
9/4/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the series are probably not a good choice for that, right?
9/4/19, 20:11 - Sara: You can
9/4/19, 20:11 - Sara: Maybe for later
9/4/19, 20:11 - Sara: The last kingdom xD
9/4/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes
9/4/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is very nice
9/4/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dark also
9/4/19, 20:12 - Sara: 😎
9/4/19, 20:12 - Sara: Nice
9/4/19, 20:12 - Sara: And any film?
9/4/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Marvel ones are nice
9/4/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't been watching many movies on netflix
9/4/19, 20:13 - Sara: I was watching a chapter with my sis about fashion so i was scrolling
9/4/19, 20:13 - Sara: And i realized there are too many films
9/4/19, 20:13 - Sara: I want to see spiderman 😂
9/4/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's very nice, good choice
9/4/19, 20:14 - Sara: I watched the first theee
9/4/19, 20:14 - Sara: Three*
9/4/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is a completely new one
9/4/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not connected
9/4/19, 20:14 - Sara: Do i have to watch any in between?
9/4/19, 20:14 - Sara: So yes
9/4/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: For Spiderman, not really
9/4/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was a self contained story
9/4/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe doctor strange could be nice for you too
9/4/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if it's available
9/4/19, 20:16 - Sara: I think so, i’ll scroll again later
9/4/19, 20:20 - Sara: But do i have to follow any order?
9/4/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spiderman and doctor strange are not really connected very much to the main storyline so doesn't matter
9/4/19, 20:21 - Sara: Great ^^
9/4/19, 20:21 - Sara: Are you studying?
9/4/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm about to, I need to solve some exercises for the exam
9/4/19, 20:23 - Sara: Okay! 💪
9/5/19, 13:41 - Sara: https://youtu.be/0omja1ivpx0 😃
9/5/19, 13:42 - Sara: https://youtu.be/7Fmpz-wIkPY and a new single 😁
9/5/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, Italy looks a little bit different than what I expected, but ok
9/5/19, 16:03 - Sara: Why? I haven’t watched the video yet 😂

9/5/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 22:58 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
9/5/19, 22:58 - Sara: TRUE
9/5/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: only I can do that with an ice cream
9/5/19, 22:58 - Sara: You are not licking it
9/5/19, 22:59 - Sara: So...

9/5/19, 23:05 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
9/5/19, 23:05 - Sara: **sending Elisa to Poland**
9/5/19, 23:05 - Sara: How is it going?
9/5/19, 23:05 - Sara: 🤔
9/5/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ask
9/5/19, 23:06 - Sara: Why that question in instagram?
9/5/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: It just looked like something more than just going out, no other reason
9/5/19, 23:08 - Sara: Why?
9/5/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: There seemed to be more effort put into your look than usual 😁
9/5/19, 23:10 - Sara: I always put effort on my outfits
9/5/19, 23:10 - Sara: Like i don’t like just putting the first thing i see
9/5/19, 23:10 - Sara: But to look like special, different, more casual
9/5/19, 23:10 - Sara: Different from going to uni or on a trip xD
9/5/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Putting effort to look effortless
9/5/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite nice 👌
9/5/19, 23:11 - Sara: I haven’t said that
9/5/19, 23:11 - Sara: Do i look effortless? XD
9/5/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not a bad thing btw
9/5/19, 23:11 - Sara: I mean, just explore my personality through my looks
9/5/19, 23:11 - Sara: Not being a normy person
9/5/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, making things you do look effortless means that you're very good at them
9/5/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like profesional athletes, for example
9/5/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So by saying effortless I didn't mean anything negative
9/5/19, 23:12 - Sara: Well, depending on what you consider effortless
9/5/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I meant negative I would rather say that something is low effort
9/5/19, 23:13 - Sara: Good example
9/5/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rather than effortless
9/5/19, 23:13 - Sara: Okay, fair enough
9/5/19, 23:14 - Sara: And what is usual? XD
9/5/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: T-shirts?
9/5/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: That dress looked rather special
9/5/19, 23:15 - Sara: Not a dress 😂
9/5/19, 23:15 - Sara: It was a long dress and then the shirt
9/5/19, 23:15 - Sara: Thanks 😁
9/5/19, 23:15 - Sara: And well, dates xd
9/5/19, 23:16 - Sara: At the moment I only have one date in my mind
9/5/19, 23:16 - Sara: 🧠
9/5/19, 23:17 - Sara: But yep, you can be direct
9/5/19, 23:17 - Sara: Do not worry
9/5/19, 23:20 - Sara: Like i have been thinking that, at least in my case, i prefer being like that
9/5/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so when should I expect your sister?
9/5/19, 23:20 - Sara: Man 😂
9/5/19, 23:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 23:21 - Sara: One week 👌🏻
9/5/19, 23:22 - Sara: I hope she does not die
9/5/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It depends, on a scale from 1 to 10 how gay does she look?
9/5/19, 23:24 - Sara: 11/10
9/5/19, 23:24 - Sara: Gayer than ever
9/5/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, ok, so how are her self defense skills then?
9/5/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: *9/11
9/5/19, 23:24 - Sara: She bites, so not bad
9/5/19, 23:25 - Sara: I thought that but she asked me to say that xd
9/5/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe she can survive Poland then
9/5/19, 23:25 - Sara: Perfect
9/5/19, 23:26 - Sara: She is ready then
9/5/19, 23:26 - Sara: Are you ready for Spaniards in September?
9/5/19, 23:27 - Sara: Just for knowing
9/5/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 23:28 - Sara: Me in my bday <3
9/5/19, 23:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/5/19, 23:29 - Sara: How was your day?
9/5/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Terrible
9/5/19, 23:29 - Sara: Por qué? D:
9/5/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I went to uni, I almost managed to get the Erasmus paperwork done and I also talked to my promoter, I sent him my results and we will discuss it on monday
9/5/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I also learned that I actually should finish the thesis by the 20th of September
9/5/19, 23:31 - Sara: Genial entonces ☺
9/5/19, 23:31 - Sara: Oh shit
9/5/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise I will have to pay, I'm not sure how much
9/5/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I returned home, pretty tired after all the stuff in Lodz and I just studied for my exam and wrote the thesis
9/5/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm done with life
9/5/19, 23:32 - Sara: :(
9/5/19, 23:32 - Sara: And how is it going? The thesis i mean
9/5/19, 23:32 - Sara: Because the exam is okay, right?
9/5/19, 23:33 - Sara: You can take your computer to Italy, if you want
9/5/19, 23:33 - Sara: Or you need
9/5/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Slowly, I got a very useful book from my promoter so I can use that
9/5/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's still a lot of work
9/5/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it will be very helpful
9/5/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be too late anyway
9/5/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just hope to do as much work as possible before going
9/5/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which means that all the days until the trip are going to be wonderful
9/5/19, 23:43 - Sara: Yes..:
9/5/19, 23:43 - Sara: They told you so late
9/5/19, 23:43 - Sara: Why?
9/5/19, 23:44 - Sara: Ypu can go though it
9/5/19, 23:44 - Sara: Morning exam, afternoon thesis
9/5/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's the plan, but it's going to be so awful 😫
9/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: A lit bit
9/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: But will be worth
9/5/19, 23:49 - Sara: I’m sure
9/5/19, 23:50 - Sara: Busier but you will finish everything
9/5/19, 23:50 - Sara: And you have time
9/5/19, 23:50 - Sara: Go for it 💪
9/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: So you can talk to me if you want to relax a bit
9/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: I don’t want to interrupt or interfere
9/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: But again, 8 days
9/6/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, not much...
9/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: Depending on how you regard it
9/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: But you will do it
9/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: You are a smart boy
9/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: :)
9/6/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/6/19, 00:17 - Sara: 😂
9/6/19, 00:17 - Sara: Well
9/6/19, 00:17 - Sara: You have a better idea to focus on?
9/6/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Many things I would prefer but now I have to do that
9/6/19, 00:18 - Sara: In your thesis i mean
9/6/19, 00:18 - Sara: You were a lit lost
9/6/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still am, we'll see what my promoter says on monday
9/6/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I definitely would prefer a different topic
9/6/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: That one was only because of the deadlines for Erasmus application
9/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: Okay
9/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: True you told me
9/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: I hope you can write something good
9/6/19, 00:20 - Sara: I don’t expect less 😊

9/6/19, 12:21 - Sara: How is it going?
9/6/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit better, I managed to get all the signatures and I gave all the Erasmus documents to the dean's office
9/6/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I just need to wait until the dean approves it
9/6/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which can be next week or next month...
9/6/19, 12:23 - Sara: I’m sure he will
9/6/19, 12:23 - Sara: Do you need to have it before your thesis?
9/6/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: He will, everything is correct in the papers so I'm not worried about it
9/6/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yes
9/6/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked about extending the deadline
9/6/19, 12:25 - Sara: Can you do that?
9/6/19, 12:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will have to request it from the dean before going to Italy
9/6/19, 12:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unfortunately, extending it is not free
9/6/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: The price depends on how much of the thesis I have written at the moment I submit the request
9/6/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I will probably do it next Friday and until then try to write as much as possible
9/6/19, 12:28 - Sara: Of course
9/6/19, 12:28 - Sara: Focus on that now :)
9/6/19, 12:28 - Sara: You can do it
9/6/19, 13:41 - Sara: <Media omitted>

9/6/19, 17:04 - Sara: But the tutor started to introduce me to all the highschool staff as a internship student/teacher
9/6/19, 17:04 - Sara: I’m basically in 😁😁😁😁😁😁
9/6/19, 17:05 - Sara: I even had to fill in some papers
9/6/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Suspicious

9/6/19, 17:07 - Sara: ☺☺
9/6/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/YR5ApYxkU-U
9/6/19, 17:12 - Sara: 😂
9/6/19, 17:12 - Sara: Fuck the system 😂
9/6/19, 17:12 - Sara: But i have to enter in it to know how to destroy it 😈
9/6/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara, leave them kids alone 🌝
9/6/19, 17:14 - Sara: Alone to do what 😈
9/6/19, 17:20 - Sara: But puf, i hope i like doing this 😂
9/6/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buah, teaching Spanish children 🤮
9/6/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, teaching children in general 🤢
9/6/19, 17:28 - Sara: Not so young 😂
9/6/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
9/6/19, 17:28 - Sara: Rt xd
9/6/19, 17:28 - Sara: Nah, they will be... 14 and 17 xd
9/6/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that case
9/6/19, 17:29 - Sara: I won’t fuck them 😂
9/6/19, 17:29 - Sara: Why that obsession with sex, Kamil 🧐
9/6/19, 17:29 - Sara: Pedophile porn, so bad
9/6/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can be creative, fuck them over with tests or something

9/6/19, 17:32 - Sara: Now I’m overthinking 😂
9/6/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/6/19, 17:33 - Sara: Not so hard to do that xD
9/6/19, 17:33 - Sara: Are you calmer?
9/6/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit, still a ton of stuff to do but at least now I know all the details and I have some sort of plan
9/6/19, 17:34 - Sara: Tutor told you something?
9/6/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet, but I know that I will have to submit that request to move the deadline anyway
9/6/19, 17:36 - Sara: Definitely?
9/6/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have to finish writing the thesis but there's also plenty of other paperwork and stuff before I can submit and it's highly unlikely that I will manage before the trip
9/6/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: So yes
9/6/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's fine
9/6/19, 17:37 - Sara: Sure?
9/6/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I will have to pay, but other than that there's no other problems with that solution
9/6/19, 17:40 - Sara: Like, i mean
9/6/19, 17:40 - Sara: The thesis is the important thing rather than the trip
9/6/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Even if I stayed it wouldn't help much
9/6/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: My promoter is also going somewhere on 15th or 16th
9/6/19, 17:47 - Sara: How much do you need to finish your thesis?
9/6/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depending on what my promoter tells me on Monday I will probably finish it somewhere next month
9/6/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably first half
9/6/19, 17:48 - Sara: October? Nice month 🌝
9/6/19, 19:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Meh, autumn 🤢
9/6/19, 19:39 - Sara: What is wrong with autumn? :(((
9/6/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: The worst season of them all
9/6/19, 19:40 - Sara: Why? Give me a reasonable explanation
9/6/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: It gets cold and rainy all the time
9/6/19, 19:40 - Sara: what you like 😁

9/7/19, 16:33 - Sara: 😂
9/7/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're laughing but we'll see what you do next time a puma attacks you
9/7/19, 16:37 - Sara: Having rockets in my vagina is a good option
9/7/19, 16:38 - Sara: I’m sure the cup can attack as well
9/7/19, 16:40 - Sara: How are you?
9/7/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Working on the thesis, I've made some progress, but I will know more on Monday after I talk with with my promoter
9/7/19, 16:46 - Sara: Nice nice, that is good
9/7/19, 16:46 - Sara: And the exam?
9/7/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems ok, my friend sent me his solutions to the exercises so that helps
9/7/19, 16:47 - Sara: You’ll have everything ready already right?
9/7/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope so
9/7/19, 17:03 - Sara: Think that you have a whole week to revise as well
9/7/19, 17:03 - Sara: That exam will be so easy, i’m sure
9/7/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

9/7/19, 21:24 - Sara: But worth it?
9/7/19, 21:24 - Sara: That is an insult ><
9/7/19, 21:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I made some progress

9/8/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Playing with your sister?
9/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: Yes :)))
9/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: And a friend of ours
9/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: We want to have a group so maybe... 🌚
9/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: I’m happy 😃
9/8/19, 14:23 - Sara: How are you?
9/8/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm writing the thesis
9/8/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to write at least 2000 words today
9/8/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: So far I wrote 600
9/8/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: With that 🌚 I'm quite convinced that you mean group sex
9/8/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which I guess would be consistent with your southern incestuous tendencies
9/8/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/ye5BuYf8q4o
9/8/19, 16:33 - Sara: You are near! You can get it between today and tomorrow
9/8/19, 16:33 - Sara: Why do you want me to have sex with children and my sister?
9/8/19, 16:33 - Sara: SUCK A PERV
9/8/19, 16:34 - Sara: Btw, Poland-Spain in basket 🌝
9/8/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want???
9/8/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said maybe... 🌚
9/8/19, 16:34 - Sara: Maybe in having a music band
9/8/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I merely pointed out the fact xd
9/8/19, 16:34 - Sara: But you are the first one in thinking in familiar sex Hahaha
9/8/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: That emoji does not suggest a music band...
9/8/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least not to me, but that's your fault
9/8/19, 16:35 - Sara: Maaaybe
9/8/19, 16:35 - Sara: But it was not my intention xd
9/8/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Suuuure
9/8/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 16:36 - Sara: I promise hahaha
9/8/19, 16:36 - Sara: You perv..:
9/8/19, 16:36 - Sara: How are you?
9/8/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wrote 1100 words
9/8/19, 16:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm listening to fiesta pagana 🎶
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: Coool 😎
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: Why now? 😂😂
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: Mago de Oz is a nice band
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: (Or used to be)
9/8/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: It just came up on my playlist
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: My uncle’s music group were playing with them in Cuenca 😁
9/8/19, 16:37 - Sara: Niceeeeee
9/8/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

9/8/19, 18:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 18:12 - Sara: btw, if you feel like later playing something, it can be nice :)
9/8/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Believe me that I would like to but I don't know if I'll manage
9/8/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wrote about 1650 words for now so I'll work some more on that to get those 2000 I planned and then I'll study for the exam
9/8/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I find some time, I'll text you
9/8/19, 19:01 - Sara: I know that you are busy
9/8/19, 19:01 - Sara: Focus on that 😁 it is just in case you want to relax
9/8/19, 19:02 - Sara: Don’t worry
9/8/19, 19:02 - Sara: I’m sure you will do it perfectly 💕

9/9/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 00:29 - Sara: 😂
9/9/19, 00:29 - Sara: Perfect translation 😂
9/9/19, 00:29 - Sara: How was your day?
9/9/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tiring, tomorrow I'm going to talk to my promoter, we'll see what he tells me
9/9/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jokes aside, what would be the correct translation?
9/9/19, 00:31 - Sara: Good luck with that!
9/9/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Al menos tres adultos?
9/9/19, 00:31 - Sara: You can say that, but it is correct as well in the picture
9/9/19, 00:31 - Sara: Both are right ^^
9/9/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 00:32 - Sara: The only problem is the number xd
9/9/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know xd
9/9/19, 00:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I wasn't sure about the translation either, so I asked
9/9/19, 00:32 - Sara: Ok ok 😂
9/9/19, 00:32 - Sara: It is okay :)
9/9/19, 00:32 - Sara: How is your spanish going?
9/9/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite well, although I'm not doing much right now because of the thesis and the exam
9/9/19, 00:34 - Sara: Fair enough
9/9/19, 00:34 - Sara: Are you calmer?
9/9/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 00:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit, I'll see after talking to my promoter
9/9/19, 00:35 - Sara: Okay, true
9/9/19, 00:35 - Sara: You tell me when you know 🤗
9/9/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, starfish xd
9/9/19, 00:35 - Sara: I don’t like starfish 🧐
9/9/19, 00:35 - Sara: Do you?
9/9/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the starfish doesn't like me anymore
9/9/19, 00:37 - Sara: Well
9/9/19, 00:37 - Sara: Do you still care?
9/9/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
9/9/19, 00:37 - Sara: She talked to me again today
9/9/19, 00:37 - Sara: Randomly, as always
9/9/19, 00:37 - Sara: I don’t understand anything xd
9/9/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you still care?
9/9/19, 00:39 - Sara: Not really
9/9/19, 00:39 - Sara: But i don’t like when people have problems with me
9/9/19, 00:40 - Sara: Or have something againts me
9/9/19, 00:40 - Sara: She left, I’m happy
9/9/19, 00:40 - Sara: Fair enough if she is happy as well
9/9/19, 00:40 - Sara: I will not fight for someone who does not care about me
9/9/19, 00:41 - Sara: Even i don’t know if she was toxic, tbh
9/9/19, 00:41 - Sara: At least for me
9/9/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps, I guess it doesn't matter anymore
9/9/19, 00:42 - Sara: Not at all
9/9/19, 00:43 - Sara: She was part of my life, she helped in my process of knowing myself after breakup, she gave what she could give
9/9/19, 00:43 - Sara: It is okay, i don’t have any resentful feeling
9/9/19, 00:43 - Sara: I learnt from bad facts, i got more mature
9/9/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair approach
9/9/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Off topic: Yesterday I had a small breakdown when I realized I've been in Poland for exactly one month now 😂
9/9/19, 00:44 - Sara: She gave me as well very good moments, so no hate to her 💕
9/9/19, 00:44 - Sara: 😢
9/9/19, 00:44 - Sara: Yes... i was thinking on that moment to
9/9/19, 00:44 - Sara: Breakup, surgery xd
9/9/19, 00:45 - Sara: How did you feel?
9/9/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: For a moment I just really wanted to go back to Ghent, just a bit more
9/9/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've watched a very nice video on YouTube called Ghent in motion
9/9/19, 00:47 - Sara: I miss it too
9/9/19, 00:47 - Sara: I really want to go back
9/9/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seeing all the places that I used to see almost every day...
9/9/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just miss it so much
9/9/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Especially since my time here since the return was far from great
9/9/19, 00:48 - Sara: What do you mean?
9/9/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Ghent I was happy, here I'm mostly stressed and worried
9/9/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's because of the current situation but still...
9/9/19, 00:49 - Sara: You are stressed because of the thesis and the exam
9/9/19, 00:49 - Sara: Maybe after the trip will be another thing
9/9/19, 00:49 - Sara: I agree, Ghent was amazing
9/9/19, 00:50 - Sara: Things have changed this month, right?
9/9/19, 00:51 - Sara: I’m sure we both agree august has been horible
9/9/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much, I was still in Ghent but it felt so empty, everybody left and I had to face the reality that Erasmus was actually over
9/9/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then I came back
9/9/19, 00:53 - Sara: Yes... 😭
9/9/19, 00:53 - Sara: And something else?
9/9/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehhh, what's the point of talking about how bad it was?
9/9/19, 00:56 - Sara: Mmmmmm
9/9/19, 00:56 - Sara: Well, up to you
9/9/19, 00:56 - Sara: In my case i want to know about you during this time
9/9/19, 00:57 - Sara: You started talking about Ghent first
9/9/19, 00:57 - Sara: Well, sorry. Not my intention.
9/9/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem, don't worry
9/9/19, 00:58 - Sara: I don’t want to make you uncomfortable
9/9/19, 00:58 - Sara: We should remember good times and learn
9/9/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least at the moment I don't really enjoy remembering them, probably because I'm not happy at all right now
9/9/19, 01:00 - Sara: When are you going to be happy?
9/9/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I knew
9/9/19, 01:00 - Sara: I’m sure you will be happy
9/9/19, 01:00 - Sara: You can go abroad and everything
9/9/19, 01:01 - Sara: Think that you will go to Italy ☺
9/9/19, 01:02 - Sara: And you will see the Italians :)
9/9/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: During the trip I'll probably feel better, afterwards, I'm not so sure
9/9/19, 01:09 - Sara: Why not?
9/9/19, 01:09 - Sara: Maybe you go more motivated
9/9/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I suppose it depends on how much I accomplish this week
9/9/19, 01:13 - Sara: As well
9/9/19, 01:13 - Sara: How much can you extend the deadline? Two weeks?
9/9/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure actually
9/9/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably the whole next semester
9/9/19, 01:14 - Sara: December/january?
9/9/19, 01:15 - Sara: Again, do not worry about the trip really
9/9/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that
9/9/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although I do hope to finish it shortly after the trip
9/9/19, 01:15 - Sara: Yes, do it asap
9/9/19, 01:16 - Sara: You will manage it
9/9/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on what my promoter tells me tomorrow, if it will be all right then probably yes
9/9/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need like maybe 20 pages more
9/9/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then I need to clean it up and improve it, but at least the first draft version
9/9/19, 01:20 - Sara: Crossed 🤞
9/9/19, 01:20 - Sara: Again, you can do it :)
9/9/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is so unfair, we had to go and wait a long time to pay for stuff in the esn office and now they started accepting payments online 😰
9/9/19, 12:25 - Sara: :ooooo
9/9/19, 12:25 - Sara: No way
9/9/19, 12:26 - Sara: Well, waiting for the queue was a excuse to have a walk so haha
9/9/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: new students won't know the joy of waiting for 2 hours 🙃
9/9/19, 12:47 - Sara: Not at all
9/9/19, 12:47 - Sara: Hahaha
9/9/19, 12:47 - Sara: At least the esn staff know us haha
9/9/19, 12:48 - Sara: How are you?
9/9/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: fine
9/9/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: you?
9/9/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 14:43 - Sara: I’m fine! Sorry
9/9/19, 14:44 - Sara: I was in my friend’s thesis exposition
9/9/19, 14:44 - Sara: I have been in his uni all the morning
9/9/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem
9/9/19, 14:44 - Sara: 😂😂😂😂
9/9/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's nice, how did it go?
9/9/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a second thought, I hate children so let them suffer
9/9/19, 14:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 14:46 - Sara: Why suffer? XD
9/9/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Twice the dad jokes or infinite loops, if that's not suffering then I don't know what is
9/9/19, 14:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But these damn kids deserve no less
9/9/19, 14:47 - Sara: It quite embarrasing xD
9/9/19, 14:47 - Sara: Why so much hate on them
9/9/19, 14:47 - Sara: HAHAHA what did they do to you?
9/9/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: *EXIST*
9/9/19, 14:48 - Sara: Good answer xd
9/9/19, 14:48 - Sara: What did you do?
9/9/19, 14:48 - Sara: Like today i mean
9/9/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I went to uni to talk to my promoter
9/9/19, 14:49 - Sara: True!! How was it? :D
9/9/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, I might have to do some additional measurements after the trip, but not too much
9/9/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, seems fine
9/9/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will extend the deadline for the thesis until the end of the next semester, I already told my promoter and he agreed
9/9/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also learned that it is possible for me to go on Erasmus internship
9/9/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: And if I delay the defense of the thesis and go still as a student I can get some additional money from the uni
9/9/19, 14:53 - Sara: Sounds nice right?
9/9/19, 14:53 - Sara: Delaying the deadline was worth it then?
9/9/19, 14:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I manage to find the internship
9/9/19, 14:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise it's just a minor inconvenience
9/9/19, 15:01 - Sara: Is there any offer?
9/9/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I briefly looked at offers posted on the website, there are some interesting ones
9/9/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll give it a shot, if not, I'll find something here
9/9/19, 15:02 - Sara: which ones? :D
9/9/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ireland, Belgium and Portugal, if I remember correctly
9/9/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I haven't checked everything yet
9/9/19, 15:44 - Sara: Ohhh seems nice
9/9/19, 15:44 - Sara: Not belgium right? 😂
9/9/19, 15:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would prefer a new place
9/9/19, 15:44 - Sara: Yeah, and cheaper
9/9/19, 15:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if it would be the best offer than I would pick it anyway
9/9/19, 15:45 - Sara: In what depends?
9/9/19, 15:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Specific job, if it pays etc.
9/9/19, 15:45 - Sara: Buah, spanishing xD
9/9/19, 15:45 - Sara: Yes, fair enough
9/9/19, 15:46 - Sara: Normally they are 3 months right?
9/9/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: 3 to 6 months
9/9/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most often at least
9/9/19, 15:47 - Sara: Nice nice
9/9/19, 15:47 - Sara: You can see after the trip
9/9/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll find something in Italy during the trip and just immediately visit the company in person xd
9/9/19, 15:49 - Sara: You really want to live in Italy right? XD
9/9/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not that much
9/9/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have no clue, after the trip I will have at least some sort of idea how it is there
9/9/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I know nothing
9/9/19, 15:56 - Sara: Hot
9/9/19, 15:57 - Sara: Well, it is about time
9/9/19, 15:57 - Sara: Right?
9/9/19, 15:57 - Sara: At least you have some idea
9/9/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: We'll see, maybe it works out
9/9/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a lot harder to find than Erasmus for studying
9/9/19, 15:59 - Sara: Why?
9/9/19, 15:59 - Sara: If the offer is there...
9/9/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the company still has to accept you
9/9/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's like looking for a job
9/9/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: With studies it's easy
9/9/19, 16:00 - Sara: But it is an internship
9/9/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: And internship is a job, no?
9/9/19, 16:01 - Sara: You have good marks, good level of english and another erasmus
9/9/19, 16:01 - Sara: Yes, but maybe they are more open to accept people
9/9/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But obviously if they find someone better they'll pick that other person
9/9/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: With erasmus studying there is no such problem
9/9/19, 16:02 - Sara: Apply for the 3 of them...?
9/9/19, 16:02 - Sara: They have to do a lot of stuff before xD
9/9/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, obviously I'm not going to apply only for one
9/9/19, 16:03 - Sara: C’mone
9/9/19, 16:03 - Sara: You’ll get at least one of the options
9/9/19, 18:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish I could have less
9/9/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, - 1 baby
9/9/19, 18:44 - Sara: -3 children hahah
9/9/19, 18:44 - Sara: Amazing
9/9/19, 18:44 - Sara: Save the planet, kill children
9/9/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then if I later get one I just have zero
9/9/19, 18:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like a get out of jail card in monopoly
9/9/19, 18:45 - Sara: Nice comparison xD
9/9/19, 18:45 - Sara: It would be a perfect planet
9/9/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Humanity would gradually go extinct and all our problems would be solved
9/9/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I love it
9/9/19, 18:47 - Sara: So
9/9/19, 18:47 - Sara: Killing children
9/9/19, 18:47 - Sara: Yes or no
9/9/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: *YES*
9/9/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely *YES*
9/9/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's also easier than killing adults
9/9/19, 18:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/9/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will do an analysis which option can kill us faster
9/9/19, 18:49 - Sara: Perfect
9/9/19, 18:49 - Sara: And the weather forefast machine later
9/9/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although I think that even if by letting the children live we could all die sooner I would still prefer to kill them
9/9/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: We would have to exist a bit longer but at least without children
9/9/19, 18:50 - Sara: Good approach
9/9/19, 18:51 - Sara: 😂😂
9/9/19, 18:53 - Sara: How are you?
9/9/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tired, I've been studying for the exam
9/9/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least for now I don't have to work so much on the thesis anymore
9/9/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will write a bit more but mostly I will continue after the trip
9/9/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's nice
9/9/19, 19:01 - Sara: Yes, you must be exhausted
9/9/19, 19:01 - Sara: Yes 😁
9/9/19, 19:01 - Sara: You should be less stressed
9/9/19, 19:01 - Sara: And you will do it great, you’ll see
9/9/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: do you have any idea where I could look for internships?
9/9/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: like a website or something?
9/9/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean in Spain
9/9/19, 19:32 - Sara: Mmmm i don’t know now
9/9/19, 19:32 - Sara: But i can search it
9/9/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: because on the erasmus websites there are actually not that many engineering internships
9/9/19, 19:32 - Sara: But i thought it depended on the uni
9/9/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can contact pretty much anybody if they agree for the erasmus deal
9/9/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: at least that's how I understood it so far
9/9/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: won't hurt to try
9/9/19, 19:33 - Sara: Of course
9/9/19, 19:33 - Sara: These days i’ll search websites
9/9/19, 19:35 - Sara: https://www.ies-consulting.es/ofertas-practicas-extranjero/
9/9/19, 19:35 - Sara: There are both, in Spain and in other countries
9/9/19, 19:36 - Sara: https://www.infojobs.net/ofertas-trabajo/madrid/practicas-ingenieria here is a general website where you can find different places
9/9/19, 19:36 - Sara: (All of them will be probably in Spanish, so if you need something tell me)
9/9/19, 19:37 - Sara: About the language, english or spanish?
9/9/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, probably english, I don't think I can be good enough in spanish fast enough

9/10/19, 11:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a dad joke
9/10/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: And children of gay parents get twice the amount of them
9/10/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which leads to the reduction of the number of children as evidenced here
9/10/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's perfect
9/10/19, 11:06 - Sara: <Media omitted>

9/10/19, 11:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, the other that you haven't noticed, the one you mentioned was just a distraction
9/10/19, 11:19 - Sara: Which one? :o
9/10/19, 11:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: One you haven't noticed

9/10/19, 14:12 - Sara: My knee is fine, ready for Italy 👍
9/10/19, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: You went to the doctor?
9/10/19, 14:14 - Sara: Yes, i have just come back
9/10/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Get used to writing sì instead of sí
9/10/19, 14:15 - Sara: I know :P
9/10/19, 14:16 - Sara: I cannot run or do any explosive movement with my knee, but the “pain” i have is normal, because the ligaments and everything are getting used to again
9/10/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: We're not going to usa or middle east so anything 'explosive' probably won't be necessary
9/10/19, 14:17 - Sara: Hahahahaha
9/10/19, 14:17 - Sara: Perfect
9/10/19, 14:17 - Sara: How are you?
9/10/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel like studying anymore but I have to
9/10/19, 14:20 - Sara: Is it going good?
9/10/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, it's just really boring at this point
9/10/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I would prefer to study something else
9/10/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something that would be useful for an internship
9/10/19, 14:34 - Sara: It is normal
9/10/19, 14:35 - Sara: Have you found something?
9/10/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't looked at them yet
9/10/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I like one in Portugal, that is similar to what I've been doing during robotics course in Ghent
9/10/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I need to revise plenty of stuff
9/10/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I have time only until end of September
9/10/19, 14:36 - Sara: Portugal is great! Which city?
9/10/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lisbon
9/10/19, 14:37 - Sara: Maybe you can see during the trip with your phone
9/10/19, 14:37 - Sara: 🥰
9/10/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unfortunately I'm not sure if they actually would pay me, in the advert it is somewhat unclear
9/10/19, 14:38 - Sara: Would you like to be paid? Or that is not important?
9/10/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's pretty important, I will get Erasmus scholarship only for two months
9/10/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the office they told me that there were already such cases so it's nothing unusual
9/10/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I need a paid internship
9/10/19, 14:39 - Sara: Fair enough
9/10/19, 14:40 - Sara: I hope you can find something
9/10/19, 16:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>

9/10/19, 16:50 - Sara: I completely forgot 😭
9/10/19, 16:50 - Sara: But they have the radio in the bus
9/10/19, 16:51 - Sara: And i could hear something
9/10/19, 16:51 - Sara: Muahaha 😈

9/11/19, 11:28 - Sara: You are already ready :P
9/11/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, I wrote it like that but than I changed my mind and used perfect
9/11/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because it was recently and it affects me right now
9/11/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, these tenses still confuse me sometimes
9/11/19, 11:29 - Sara: But it was yesterday
9/11/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I have the second part on Saturday that I still have to study for
9/11/19, 11:29 - Sara: It is a finished action

9/11/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Second part of the course
9/11/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But in general it looks like prof doesn't give very complicated exercises on the exam
9/11/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the exercises he gave as homework there are some awful but fortunately on the exam there should be only fairly simple ones
9/11/19, 11:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but I also read that if that past influences the present than it's also perfect tense, idk

9/24/19, 17:20 - Sara: Everything okay?
9/24/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I went with Nicco, met some of his friends and then went to San Luca
9/24/19, 18:55 - Sara: How was it? Worth it?
9/24/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: The view is quite nice, but it's a long walk, there is no way that we could've made it yesterday
9/24/19, 19:04 - Sara: How much time did you do?
9/24/19, 19:04 - Sara: Well, how much time it takes
9/24/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Over 1 hour one way, but we didn't walk fast
9/24/19, 19:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: More or less from the center

9/24/19, 19:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: About what?
9/24/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite nice but she doesn't speak English very well
9/24/19, 22:24 - Sara: I don’t know, maybe the whole situation. I do not know how to act or how to deal it
9/24/19, 22:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
9/24/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to behave like Cristina, if you ask me something I'm not going to ignore you
9/24/19, 22:52 - Sara: You don’t want space?
9/24/19, 22:52 - Sara: Talking about Cristina... xd
9/24/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do but if you ask I won't ignore it
9/24/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: What about her?
9/25/19, 00:54 - Sara: I’ll respect it then
9/25/19, 00:54 - Sara: Random stuff as always 😂 her nose was bleeding
9/25/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thanks
9/25/19, 07:53 - Sara: One last thing to say: do not repress your feelings and thoughts
9/28/19, 14:36 - Sara: What is it happening, Kamil?
9/28/19, 14:40 - Sara: I do not understand why you talk to me like that
9/28/19, 14:51 - Sara: Both of us are emotionally shitty, let’s assume that
9/28/19, 14:55 - Sara: Don’t hurt me as you have done
9/28/19, 14:57 - Sara: If you have something againts me, say it
9/28/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, I made a mistake, ignore it
9/28/19, 14:58 - Sara: I cannot ignore it
9/28/19, 14:58 - Sara: There must be a reason for that
9/28/19, 15:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just had a moment of weakness, forget it
9/28/19, 15:02 - Sara: I’ll try
9/28/19, 15:02 - Sara: You don’t know how much i want to know about you
9/28/19, 15:02 - Sara: Ans to help you
10/1/19, 12:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Feliz cumpleaños Sara, I think I did that already a few times but it never hurts to repeat that, thank you for everything, you made me very happy in Ghent and I learned a lot from you, for that I will always be grateful. No matter what happens and what you do, I just wish you to be happy, in the end, nothing else matters. I hope you succeed at university and later at whatever career you choose to pursue, I'm sure you will be great at it and I also hope that you will always be surrounded by great people that will care about you.

10/1/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just 1,5 hour in plane and rest in busses, trains or waiting
10/1/19, 20:06 - Sara: And the last days in Italy?
10/1/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was ok, I spent some time with Nicco, met some of his friends, went to San Luca with one of them
10/1/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I watched an Italian movie in Thelma's house called cado dalle nubi

10/1/19, 20:16 - Sara: I need it
10/1/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: No point, I don't want to spread the sadness, I'm accepting the situation and slowly moving on
10/1/19, 20:18 - Sara: What do you have to accept?
10/1/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: The reality right now
10/1/19, 20:19 - Sara: Which is...?
10/1/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lonely
10/1/19, 20:19 - Sara: Because you are in Poland?
10/1/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why are we talking about this, it's your birthday
10/1/19, 20:21 - Sara: Because I care about you and you have been in my mind this whole time
10/1/19, 20:21 - Sara: And I really want to help and to solve this
10/1/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will finish working on the thesis, hopefully move out somewhere else and build myself a new life, that's pretty much it
10/1/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next month or two will be difficult but I don't really have a choice
10/1/19, 20:23 - Sara: If you let me, i’d like to write you
10/1/19, 20:23 - Sara: Maybe not now (i have some stuff to do) but i’d like to
10/1/19, 20:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm getting better at Spanish so I guess you can help me with that
10/1/19, 20:24 - Sara: Well, I meant about what I think or feel
10/1/19, 20:24 - Sara: But that is also fine ☺
10/1/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: From time to time if you want
10/1/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I'm not going to ignore you
10/1/19, 20:25 - Sara: Up to you
10/1/19, 20:26 - Sara: It is like... giving my persoective and you decide what to do with it
10/1/19, 20:26 - Sara: And forget it
10/1/19, 20:27 - Sara: It is like in The Square Table from monty Python
10/1/19, 20:28 - Sara: Even if i do not have arms or legs i need to keep going
10/1/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can try
10/1/19, 20:29 - Sara: Okay
10/1/19, 20:29 - Sara: So i’ll try to say it asap
10/1/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/1/19, 20:29 - Sara: Real Madrid sucks
10/1/19, 20:29 - Sara: Nothing new xd
10/1/19, 20:30 - Sara: Also off topic
10/1/19, 20:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/1/19, 20:30 - Sara: It can be really nice for you :P
10/1/19, 20:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/1/19, 20:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: June in Italy, very funny
10/1/19, 20:31 - Sara: June is Berlin 🤔 i think
10/1/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, it's Geneva, not Genova, ok
10/1/19, 20:32 - Sara: France?
10/1/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
10/1/19, 20:33 - Sara: Ugh
10/1/19, 20:34 - Sara: XD
10/3/19, 20:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to say something, just say it
10/3/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what I'm going to do going forward
10/3/19, 20:46 - Sara: Is it going to be useful?
10/3/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 20:47 - Sara: That is why I say I understand the space
10/3/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since I returned from Italy I was going back and forth between 2,3 and 4, maybe once I reach 5 I can figure something out
10/3/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk but if you don't do it we'll never know
10/3/19, 20:48 - Sara: And what about now?
10/3/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yesterday was depression, today anger, tomorrow I don't know, so far not really moving forward
10/3/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe slowly
10/3/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be easier once I finish the degree and move forward
10/3/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I have a lot of things that make me sad and anxious, not just you, so it's difficult to separate
10/3/19, 20:51 - Sara: Why difficult?
10/3/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: You try to move on with one thing but the rest keeps you in place, stagnant
10/3/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hard to be optimistic
10/3/19, 20:53 - Sara: Understandable
10/3/19, 20:54 - Sara: Maybe it is the best for you to focus on yourself, but I want to be a support
10/3/19, 20:55 - Sara: https://youtu.be/KmAyryKG6ig
10/3/19, 20:56 - Sara: Again, I want the best for you and not a disadvantage or a burden
10/3/19, 21:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't really have anyone else to focus on anymore so probably yes
10/3/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: A month or two and then maybe I can do finally something with my life
10/3/19, 21:05 - Sara: If you want, not because you there isn’t another alternative...
10/3/19, 21:05 - Sara: Let’s hope so :)
10/3/19, 21:10 - Sara: So, you know i’m here no matter what
10/3/19, 21:11 - Sara: Text me, call me when you are ready or you feel like talking
10/3/19, 21:12 - Sara: I think I’m pushing or alterating you when I shouldn’t
10/3/19, 21:13 - Sara: I want you to be okay and to be happy, and self-discovering is frightening during the process but alse beautiful when you reach it
10/3/19, 21:14 - Sara: And if you live someone else, just let me know in case I have to buy plane tickets 👧🏽✈
10/3/19, 21:15 - Sara: You can do it Kamil, you are not alone 💕
10/3/19, 21:16 - Sara: Thanks for everything and, well, as you know, I love you 💋
10/3/19, 21:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:22 - Sara: Indirect? 😂
10/3/19, 21:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:25 - Sara: I wish that never happens
10/3/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:27 - Sara: Okay, that one is good 😂
10/3/19, 21:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/3/19, 21:29 - Sara: Thanks. I hope you still choose me
10/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/4/19, 20:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/4/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Today I learned that apparently Spain is the healthiest country in the world and Spanish people have the longest life expectancy and that worries me
10/4/19, 20:15 - Sara: Why worries you?
10/4/19, 20:15 - Sara: Spaniards are the best :B
10/4/19, 20:15 - Sara: Better than Japanese
10/4/19, 20:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: At staying alive, yes
10/4/19, 20:16 - Sara: Imagine hundreds of Spaniards in Bled ^^
10/4/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think that ranking takes into account boat accidents so in that case Spain would probably be a lot lower
10/4/19, 20:20 - Sara: And splashing water?
10/4/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: That certainly makes polish lifes shorter and more miserable
10/4/19, 20:26 - Sara: And insulting(?)
10/4/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't need Spanish to be miserable and swear a lot
10/4/19, 20:30 - Sara: You are not that and you know it
10/5/19, 10:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/5/19, 23:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/5/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: 0,1% and I had to run into one, I should try my luck(bad luck?) on the lottery
10/6/19, 00:00 - Sara: You can try
10/6/19, 00:00 - Sara: Bur vegans are the demon
10/6/19, 00:00 - Sara: Maybe it is more bad luck :p
10/6/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed
10/6/19, 00:01 - Sara: 👻
10/6/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Life without cheese...
10/6/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'd rather die
10/6/19, 00:02 - Sara: Vegan cheese 🤙🏼
10/6/19, 00:02 - Sara: Please
10/6/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💩
10/6/19, 00:02 - Sara: First try, then judge 🌝
10/6/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: No cheese, no ice cream, I'll pass
10/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: Also vegan ice-cream
10/6/19, 00:03 - Sara: We can survice
10/6/19, 00:04 - Sara: **Sara chockes with a broccoli**
10/6/19, 00:04 - Sara: Survive*
10/6/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a difference between surviving and living
10/6/19, 00:05 - Sara: We live happily
10/6/19, 00:05 - Sara: I’m the perfect example
10/6/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You found other things to enjou
10/6/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: *enjoy
10/6/19, 00:07 - Sara: Which things?
10/6/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌚
10/6/19, 00:09 - Sara: Oh yes
10/6/19, 00:09 - Sara: Definitely
10/6/19, 00:09 - Sara: Food makes me enjoy 😊
10/6/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, eating for sure
10/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: I’ll always be the sexual predator, right? x)
10/6/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: At this point, yes
10/6/19, 00:10 - Sara: Why?
10/6/19, 00:11 - Sara: If you knew
10/6/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to know
10/6/19, 00:13 - Sara: I don’t want to be judged for something i’m not
10/6/19, 00:13 - Sara: Not fair
10/6/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, sexual predator was a joke
10/6/19, 00:14 - Sara: Was it?
10/6/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sexually active and sexual predator is quite a bit different
10/6/19, 00:15 - Sara: Again
10/6/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: None of my business, so I'm not judging you
10/6/19, 00:16 - Sara: If that makes your perception change, partially it is mine
10/6/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't matter anymore
10/6/19, 00:17 - Sara: Why?
10/6/19, 00:19 - Sara: Just tell me if you want me to definitely disappear
10/6/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: What you do is none of my business, you're free to do what you want, you always were
10/6/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to talk about that, if you have something else, feel free
10/6/19, 00:21 - Sara: I know
10/6/19, 00:21 - Sara: Have what? Something to say?
10/6/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something to say, something to talk about
10/6/19, 00:26 - Sara: Better to wait until everything is stable
10/6/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/6/19, 00:27 - Sara: Do you think it will last almost forever?
10/6/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/6/19, 00:33 - Sara: Up to you
10/6/19, 00:36 - Sara: Have fun
10/6/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: At certain amount of vodka it's impossible not to
10/6/19, 00:58 - Sara: 🎉
10/6/19, 00:58 - Sara: Man, tequila shot?
10/6/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vodka shot and then best juice I've ever had in my life
10/6/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: None of that shitty mediterranean stuff
10/6/19, 01:02 - Sara: Great
10/6/19, 01:02 - Sara: I’m happy that you are having fun
10/6/19, 01:02 - Sara: You deserve it
10/6/19, 01:02 - Sara: I’m writing poetry
10/6/19, 01:03 - Sara: Because we don’t have that here 😂
10/6/19, 01:06 - Sara: Hope you have a good night
10/6/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Poetry and Spanish? How?
10/6/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: ¡Imposible!
10/6/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: !Horrible!
10/6/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: !Horroroso¡
10/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: Hahahaha
10/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: Better than polish poetry
10/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: I’m sure
10/6/19, 12:00 - Sara: How was it?
10/6/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite nice, drinking and video games
10/6/19, 15:24 - Sara: Cool
10/6/19, 15:24 - Sara: With your uni friends?
10/6/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/6/19, 15:27 - Sara: That is great! I’m happy you have finally met them ☺
10/6/19, 15:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/6/19, 18:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: "YASS, I'm going to sell you to some rich assholes for so much 💵"
10/6/19, 19:07 - Sara: Doing business 😈
10/7/19, 23:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/7/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/7/19, 23:43 - Sara: You sleep and drink in front of your mirror
10/7/19, 23:43 - Sara: And complain
10/7/19, 23:43 - Sara: Always complaining 😬
10/7/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

10/10/19, 18:57 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/10/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have fun
10/10/19, 19:34 - Sara: How are you?
10/10/19, 19:43 - Sara: Better?
10/10/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good enough
10/10/19, 20:00 - Sara: What have you been doing these days?
10/10/19, 20:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/10/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just working on the thesis
10/10/19, 20:19 - Sara: And have you advanced?
10/10/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/10/19, 20:26 - Sara: When do you have to send it?
10/10/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Deadline is in February
10/10/19, 21:11 - Sara: Oh, you have time then
10/10/19, 21:11 - Sara: Less stressed, right?
10/10/19, 21:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
10/10/19, 21:16 - Sara: That is nice
10/10/19, 21:16 - Sara: And your Spanish?
10/10/19, 21:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lo mejora
10/10/19, 21:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lentamente
10/10/19, 21:18 - Sara: *Lo mejoro
10/10/19, 21:18 - Sara: That is nice
10/10/19, 21:18 - Sara: Maybe you can translate stuff
10/10/19, 21:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to say that it improves
10/10/19, 21:19 - Sara: Mmmm
10/10/19, 21:19 - Sara: If that is the meaning i’d say “va mejorando”
10/10/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
10/10/19, 21:21 - Sara: ☺
10/10/19, 21:21 - Sara: Sure everything is okay?
10/10/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/10/19, 21:26 - Sara: Okay, i hope you are okay
10/10/19, 21:26 - Sara: Ans that you have read my poem 🤗
10/13/19, 14:10 - Sara: Maybe I'm a little bit ridiculous but yesterday I saw our pictures from Oostende and I think they are two of the most beautiful photos I have
10/13/19, 14:11 - Sara: It is obvious that I miss you and that I want the best for you, probably this is a reminder. I hope everything gets solved for you soon. I really care.
10/13/19, 14:13 - Sara: Also this is obvious, but the first poem I wrote is for you (pretends to be shooked). You decide to read it or not. I miss you, i don't lie.
10/13/19, 14:14 - Sara: I needed to say this, sorry if I have annoyed you. That is the last thing I want to do but at least it is a reminder that i'm still here.
10/13/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry about it, just keep going forward and be happy, I'll try to do the same
10/13/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: (probably because Gabriel and Angelo don't feel like sharing their photos)
10/13/19, 22:17 - Sara: But I want to be happy with you in my life, is that hard to understand and hard to make it real?
10/13/19, 22:17 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/13/19, 22:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think they took some nice photos
10/13/19, 22:18 - Sara: Probably, I’ll ask them
10/13/19, 22:19 - Sara: But again, if you want to forget me or not to keep contact, just tell me
10/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: But believe me that i’d go to Poland tomorrow if I could
10/13/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Current ruling party probably won today's election so I would prefer to leave
10/13/19, 22:44 - Sara: Well
10/13/19, 22:44 - Sara: If I see you that is fine
10/13/19, 22:44 - Sara: I don’t know your vision about us or me
10/13/19, 22:45 - Sara: But i don’t there, there isn’t any day i don’t think about you
10/14/19, 01:40 - Sara: This message was deleted
10/14/19, 01:51 - Sara: This situation drives me insane
10/14/19, 02:13 - Sara: And I don’t know how to feel
10/14/19, 11:54 - Sara: Like... I don't know if you are playing with me or what is going on with your mind. Why aren't you clear with me? If you don't want any contact with me, tell me, but don't make me keep faith when there isn't or avoid the topic. I'm not silly.
10/14/19, 12:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Faith in what? I already told you that I don't want anything romantic with you. As for anything else, I don't know, maybe over time it will be easier, for the moment I remember everything too well
10/14/19, 12:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: That was the whole point of getting space instead of just saying bye, it was fun but it's over
10/14/19, 12:10 - Sara: Thanks for saying it clear, that is what i wanted
10/14/19, 12:10 - Sara: But i know you don’t want anything romantic
10/14/19, 12:11 - Sara: I just wanted your friendship, but well, you are too cold
10/14/19, 12:11 - Sara: Because you don’t want or you cannot?
10/14/19, 12:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's because back in Ghent, especially the last few weeks were one of the best of my life, because of you. When I was with you it felt like heaven, like all the problems dissappeared, it was so peaceful and happy
10/14/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: And now I don't feel that anymore, I don't feel at home when I see you and that's probably what hurts the most
10/14/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that's why it's difficult for me to keep in touch
10/14/19, 12:15 - Sara: Why not? And what in Italy?
10/14/19, 12:17 - Sara: What have I done to make you feel that?
10/14/19, 12:17 - Sara: In that case, i’ll step aside. But you shouldn’t be afraid, or consider me as the one in Ghent
10/14/19, 12:18 - Sara: I see you as the one now, as the one in Italy. And I hope I can see you again.
10/14/19, 12:19 - Sara: Many times I think what situation there would be in we were in the same place (again)
10/14/19, 12:20 - Sara: And it is hurtful not to see you everyday, but I know that I can do something to see you and to keep contact. Because I want to, and because I care about you.
10/14/19, 12:20 - Sara: I don’t deny the feelings I have for you. I understand them.
10/14/19, 12:22 - Sara: I have the feeling that you restrain your thoughts and you deny them. But I understand it if that the best for you.
10/14/19, 12:22 - Sara: If someone makes me happy, i’ll try to make that person be near me. But it is not about only one person doing it.
10/14/19, 12:23 - Sara: Idk, that is my vision. But I can respect yours, also it hurts like swords
10/14/19, 12:23 - Sara: If it is about help, I can help
10/14/19, 12:25 - Sara: You may think that i’m crazy, insistent (and if I annoy you, tell me to stop) but I know, probably, what you think
10/14/19, 12:26 - Sara: It is nor fair that distance keep us apart
10/14/19, 12:31 - Sara: Like... knowing about you makes me feel good
10/14/19, 12:33 - Sara: And in general you make me feel happy, no matter as a couple, friend or whatever. Why should ai avoid you? That is my perception.  But if it is better for you to cut the link, i’ll accept it
10/14/19, 12:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I prefer to keep the image of you from Ghent, one that made the happiest I've ever been
10/14/19, 12:38 - Sara: You don’t like the now me?
10/14/19, 12:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really feel like I know you anymore and I don't have many memories with the 'now' you
10/14/19, 12:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: A few good ones and two of the most of the most painful in my life
10/14/19, 12:43 - Sara: Don’t you want to give me the opportunity?
10/14/19, 12:43 - Sara: Are you going to judge me for the one who commited that mistake?
10/14/19, 12:43 - Sara: Is that fair?
10/14/19, 12:44 - Sara: What about Italy? That is not the real me but a fake one?
10/14/19, 12:46 - Sara: I don’t understand anything and why you treat me like that
10/14/19, 12:50 - Sara: Why do you want to end like this? 😖
10/14/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mistake? Two months ago you made your choice, you chose yourself over us and that's fair enough, I wouldn't call it a mistake
10/14/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the long run it was probably a good choice, your life is in Spain
10/14/19, 13:01 - Sara: Having in consideration that my mental health was shit and you still consider that it is “me over us” makes me feel that you don’t have empathy
10/14/19, 13:02 - Sara: I don’t know how it is going to be, so don’t decide for me
10/14/19, 13:02 - Sara: You only care about me as a couple?
10/14/19, 13:03 - Sara: And surprise, feelings don’t go
10/14/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was taking into consideration those factors, in Italy you were in a much better shape and you confirmed that choice, so again, fair enough, it hurts but I understand and accept it
10/14/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not deciding anything, just hope that you'll be all right
10/14/19, 13:05 - Sara: Well, since then I have changed and I have a perspective
10/14/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Surprise, surprise, taking a step back after being close with someone is difficult, maybe not even possible, I don't know
10/14/19, 13:06 - Sara: Why?
10/14/19, 13:06 - Sara: Well, depending on your aim
10/14/19, 13:06 - Sara: Which one is it?
10/14/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't matter, it's not possible with you anymore anyway
10/14/19, 13:09 - Sara: Being a couple?
10/14/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm definitely not going back to pretending to not be one, like we did in Ghent for far too long
10/14/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't really want that either anymore and you told me that you don't want that too
10/14/19, 13:12 - Sara: And do we have to pretend we don’t care about the other?
10/14/19, 13:12 - Sara: How do you want to treat me?
10/14/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want space which I told you already in Italy, maybe I can get over it and just be your friend, maybe not
10/14/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: People say that time heals the wounds but I don't believe that
10/14/19, 13:15 - Sara: That is what you think you have to do and what you feel like doing?
10/14/19, 13:16 - Sara: Which wounds do you have?
10/14/19, 13:17 - Sara: I learnt that you don’t have to forget people or move on, or to get far from them  if you want to have them close and you still love them
10/14/19, 13:18 - Sara: (And it’s reciprocated, obv)
10/14/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Easier to do when you found someone else to love
10/14/19, 13:19 - Sara: Love? That is a big word
10/14/19, 13:20 - Sara: I don’t know, love has different shapes according to the people
10/14/19, 13:20 - Sara: But of course I feel some stronger than others
10/14/19, 13:20 - Sara: You tell me that as if I don’t love you or as if I use people
10/14/19, 13:21 - Sara: Why do you deny that I still have feelings for you and I want to keep you in my life?
10/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: You deny me loving you and giving you affection
10/14/19, 13:27 - Sara: If you want to love me, do it. If you want to talk to me, do it. If you want to travel with me, do it. Feel free.
10/14/19, 13:28 - Sara: Life is not that structured or determinist
10/14/19, 13:29 - Sara: I don’t want to kill what we have. And if it dies, it is for natural reasons.
10/14/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess we are not compatible, different worldview, different goals and dreams, different countries
10/14/19, 13:42 - Sara: Are we that different?
10/14/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It would probably be much easier if we were just friends and stayed that way in Ghent
10/14/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: But we didn't and inevitably it led to a rift
10/14/19, 13:43 - Sara: Being friends is not enough?
10/14/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not after having something more, not for me
10/14/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least not at the moment
10/14/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Later, I don't know
10/14/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I find love again, then perhaps
10/14/19, 13:44 - Sara: ?
10/14/19, 13:45 - Sara: I don’t understand
10/14/19, 13:46 - Sara: You don’t care about me in that sense?
10/14/19, 13:46 - Sara: Why don’t you let me love you?
10/14/19, 13:46 - Sara: And why do you restrict yourself so much?
10/14/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes I feel like you completely forget all the conversations we had before, in Ghent, in Italy, over the phone, we talked about my issues, what I want and what I don't, I'm not going to repeat myself every time
10/14/19, 13:48 - Sara: So you don’t care about me, right?
10/14/19, 13:49 - Sara: In Italy we also were as we were...
10/14/19, 13:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you told me you didn't want to be as we were in Ghent so make up your mind
10/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: ?
10/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: The opposite
10/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: I felt amazing during the trip, Kamil
10/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: Oh, in Ghent?
10/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: How we were?
10/14/19, 13:51 - Sara: Mmm as before being a couple?
10/14/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not that again
10/14/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last month
10/14/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I realized that if I didn't pretend that weren't together and talked about being actually together it would have probably saved us both a lot of pain
10/14/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, lesson for the future
10/14/19, 13:54 - Sara: So being a couple was a bad option for you?
10/14/19, 13:54 - Sara: No idea tbh i have different perspectives
10/14/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: For some reason I didn't want that at the beginning
10/14/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perspective changes, I suppose
10/14/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I regret that it took me so long
10/14/19, 13:55 - Sara: I learnt a lot in a month so..
10/14/19, 13:55 - Sara: It’s sad hearing that you regret what we had
10/14/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't regret that, I regret that it took us so long to actually be a couple
10/14/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it happened in May or april it would save us a lot of pain
10/14/19, 13:56 - Sara: In that case, yes
10/14/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: And maybe everything would be different
10/14/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: *march
10/14/19, 13:57 - Sara: I forgive you for what happened
10/14/19, 13:57 - Sara: We were talking a lot about that
10/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: And although it was difficult to undertand, now I do
10/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: And I have learnt about the importamce of communication and the control of feelimgs
10/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: We didn’t do it well
10/14/19, 13:59 - Sara: I was afraid of telling you I liked you because ai thiught it wasn’t going to be reciprocate
10/14/19, 13:59 - Sara: But that is past for me, completely
10/14/19, 13:59 - Sara: I focus on the present
10/14/19, 13:59 - Sara: In the last months in Ghent, in Italy, and in what happened in august and I want to heal
10/14/19, 14:01 - Sara: I have met great people, but I feel a little bit of emptiness
10/14/19, 14:03 - Sara: Is still in your mind what happened in March/April?
10/14/19, 14:03 - Sara: I’m here to change completely the situation and let behind what we did (at least, i consider myself more mature since then)
10/14/19, 14:04 - Sara: But i won’t force you, although it is hard to let you go
10/14/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am afraid of you, of your approach, you say that you have control over you feelings but I am not convinced, you said you don't want a relationship but the way you acted in Italy says otherwise, also the always present fact that I am very uncomfortable with open relationships puts me in a tough spot, I already suffered and I don't want to suffer anymore
10/14/19, 14:34 - Sara: I love you and that is why I was like that in Italy. I have that clear.
10/14/19, 14:36 - Sara: I don’t need us to consider a couple to treat you like that, because my affection for you goes beyond that
10/14/19, 14:38 - Sara: I’m rethinking about my conception about love, sex, relationships. Well, now I can reach my conclusions with new information.
10/14/19, 14:40 - Sara: The key is that i don’t want to lose people I care. I don’t want to lose you.
10/14/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: You keep saying that but how is that different from how we were in Ghent before we became a couple?
10/14/19, 14:42 - Sara: In my case, I didn’t know your perception about you (if you loved me, mainly) and there wasn’t communication
10/14/19, 14:43 - Sara: I told you I thought you hated me or you were trying to avoid me
10/14/19, 14:43 - Sara: We barely knew each other
10/14/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't mean the very beginning
10/14/19, 14:44 - Sara: Then, for me it is the same
10/14/19, 14:44 - Sara: Maybe with you in a couple i knew you more
10/14/19, 14:45 - Sara: Because in April/May things were weird
10/14/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
10/14/19, 14:46 - Sara: What is being a couple for youV
10/14/19, 14:46 - Sara: ?
10/14/19, 14:46 - Sara: Like why do you want to put limits on us?
10/14/19, 14:47 - Sara: Or why do you need me to be your couple to treat me like that?
10/14/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already told you that in my opinion that treatment makes us a couple, whether you call it that way or not
10/14/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you call water a fire it doesn't change the water
10/14/19, 14:49 - Sara: So I like being in a couple with you
10/14/19, 14:49 - Sara: Because I love you, I trust you, I like spending time with you
10/14/19, 14:50 - Sara: Is that a problem?
10/14/19, 14:52 - Sara: But in my perspective I don’t need a name to treat you like that
10/14/19, 14:54 - Sara: I don’t know what is a couple anymore
10/14/19, 14:56 - Sara: For me this is like getting married. No difference if love is still there.
10/14/19, 14:58 - Sara: And even if we are friends, my feelings for you are going to be there despite being changed in a different shape.
10/14/19, 14:58 - Sara: I want you to be part of my life, idk if it is vice versa.
10/14/19, 15:00 - Sara: I propose you to start over everything
10/14/19, 15:05 - Sara: Maybe I’m afraid of feeling enclosured in a close relationship, but at the same time I can reach really close relations without having sex, for instance.
10/14/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I suppose I am sort of traditional in the kind of relationship I want (similar to the last month in Ghent I suppose) and trying something with you again is not going to get me there, just make everything unbelievably complicated if I meet someone else and I prefer to keep it simple
10/14/19, 15:11 - Sara: Keep it simple?
10/14/19, 15:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: One relationship at a time
10/14/19, 15:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I learned from my mistakes in Ghent when I was kind of going after a few things at the same time and it didn't end well
10/14/19, 15:14 - Sara: It was because lack of communication
10/14/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to ask anything from you because you have different values and desires and I respect that
10/14/19, 15:14 - Sara: I can tell you my thoughts now about this
10/14/19, 15:15 - Sara: And one case is representative?
10/14/19, 15:15 - Sara: And well, if you find somebody else that makes you happier, i don’t have any problem I suppose
10/14/19, 15:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I learned that I value the stability far more than random hookups
10/14/19, 15:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, yes, one case was enough
10/14/19, 15:16 - Sara: I agree
10/14/19, 15:16 - Sara: If I’m honest, I miss that
10/14/19, 15:17 - Sara: It’s empty
10/14/19, 15:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And yet:
10/14/19, 15:18 - Sara: Probably it’s contraditory
10/14/19, 15:18 - Sara: But it’s a fear of feeling like that again probably
10/14/19, 15:19 - Sara: I have to figure out about you, about relationships and everything
10/14/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/14/19, 15:34 - Sara: Did we see it? I don’t remember it
10/14/19, 15:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember seeing it, I think it was near the exit
10/14/19, 15:36 - Sara: No idea :,(
10/14/19, 15:36 - Sara: I’m concerned about losing you if you don’t love me as a couple, that is a perception I have
10/14/19, 15:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me, if it's not love between family or something of that sorts, loving, if reciprocated makes two people a couple
10/14/19, 15:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't think I can love you in any other way
10/14/19, 15:45 - Sara: You don’t to keep me even as a friend?
10/14/19, 15:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
10/14/19, 15:50 - Sara: So i’m not that important for you
10/14/19, 15:50 - Sara: To keep me in your life
10/14/19, 15:51 - Sara: But yes, definitely is difficult
10/14/19, 15:51 - Sara: I have a mix of feelings right now
10/14/19, 15:52 - Sara: Time will say, but i don’t like time taking decisions for me
10/14/19, 15:52 - Sara: But i cannot do anything else, I suppose
10/14/19, 15:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Broken heart changes perception
10/14/19, 15:54 - Sara: I’m not important anymore?
10/14/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not as important as you used to be
10/14/19, 15:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some time ago I would have given everything to stay with you, now I'm not so sure
10/14/19, 15:57 - Sara: Didn’t show you anything in Italy?
10/14/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: You wanted to fix things but your idea of fixing it, if I understood correctly was to convince me to just accept everything
10/14/19, 15:59 - Sara: Fixing the relationship?
10/14/19, 15:59 - Sara: Accept everything...?
10/14/19, 16:00 - Sara: Of course i want to be okay with you
10/14/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what you shown me in Italy was rather confusing too, on one hand behave like a couple on another you don't want to be a couple
10/14/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also this now
10/14/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: You've noticed contradiction yourself
10/14/19, 16:03 - Sara: I want but idk if I’m or in the moment to have it or if a close one would be the for me
10/14/19, 16:04 - Sara: Because I love you, simple
10/14/19, 16:05 - Sara: And even having you in my life i’d be happy
10/14/19, 16:06 - Sara: I have to see as well how is my situation
10/14/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to ask anything from you, your life, your choices
10/14/19, 16:15 - Sara: What should we do?
10/14/19, 16:15 - Sara: Well, i’m telling you that i want to have you in my life
10/14/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I was referring to that
10/14/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I made my feelings and view of things clear so you know my point of view
10/14/19, 16:17 - Sara: Yes, and I will see what happens
10/14/19, 16:18 - Sara: Basically all or nothing, right?
10/14/19, 16:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of, in the future maybe it can change, now something in the middle would be painful for me
10/14/19, 16:20 - Sara: Understandable
10/14/19, 16:20 - Sara: I’ll need my time to see how this is going on
10/14/19, 16:20 - Sara: Painful as well
10/14/19, 16:21 - Sara: When is the future?
10/14/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow, next month, next year, next decade, I don't know, there isn't exactly any road map or instruction available
10/14/19, 16:23 - Sara: Puf...
10/14/19, 16:23 - Sara: This is going to be hard
10/14/19, 16:25 - Sara: I hope to know the exact momento know about you again
10/14/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zABLecsR5UE
10/14/19, 16:28 - Sara: https://youtu.be/1Fn5Jz-OowY
10/14/19, 16:32 - Sara: You are still someone to love
10/19/19, 21:46 - Sara: Maybe it is useless to say this but I wanted to apologize for everything what happened; for making you feel you weren’t enough, for letting you down, for confusing you. It wasn’t my intention. I care about you a lot and I don’t want to end like this at all. I hope everything goes okay.
10/19/19, 21:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: How did you feel when you found out that Guada found himself someone new, shortly after you broke up?
10/19/19, 22:04 - Sara: Why do you say that?
10/19/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you don't want to answer, that's fine, I'll tell you how I felt in Genova: expendable and used
10/19/19, 22:06 - Sara: Because yes
10/19/19, 22:06 - Sara: I have forgotten about Kamil
10/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: Yayy
10/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: Why in Genova?
10/19/19, 22:07 - Sara: What else will I know?
10/19/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: After we talked at night
10/19/19, 22:08 - Sara: You don’t know my situation at the moment, don’t judge me for that
10/19/19, 22:09 - Sara: And if you want to attack me like that, I don’t deserve it at all
10/19/19, 22:11 - Sara: You forget that my feelings towards you are still here and they are killing me
10/19/19, 22:12 - Sara: I came just in a friendly way
10/19/19, 22:12 - Sara: I felt terrible
10/19/19, 22:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Being quickly replaced hurts more than I expected
10/19/19, 22:14 - Sara: You haven’t been replaced
10/19/19, 22:14 - Sara: Ugh
10/19/19, 22:15 - Sara: I want to be again with you somehow but you hate me 💫
10/19/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hypothetical situation: imagine someone has a dog, that dog is making them happy but then they find themself a partner that is allergic to dogs. Dog is a problem so they get rid off the dog, how do you judge that?
10/19/19, 22:19 - Sara: In this case, the dog is not allergic
10/19/19, 22:20 - Sara: And we are making this complicated
10/19/19, 22:22 - Sara: In this case, i’m trying to find solutions
10/19/19, 22:23 - Sara: But you have problems with me, tell them all or just say you don’t want to fix this
10/19/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: The point was that when being together wasn't convenient anymore you ended it and you said that you were in bad shape then but you confirmed it again in Italy and you said you were in better shape then
10/19/19, 22:28 - Sara: Define better shape
10/19/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mental shape, I suppose, I don't know what exactly you meant
10/19/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have two stories now: the story of your words and the story of your actions
10/19/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: And actions speak louder than any words
10/19/19, 22:31 - Sara: And my actions are... the ones I told you in Genova or the ones I had experiences at the moment?
10/19/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: The ones you told me, the breakup, in Italy you just confirmed your previous choice, fair enough
10/19/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a fine choice but it doesn't include me
10/19/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is again, fair enough
10/19/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Ya estás muerto"
10/19/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the end I have to agree with that sentence
10/20/19, 00:16 - Sara: You didn’t understand the whole poem
10/20/19, 00:17 - Sara: 🤦🏽‍♀
10/20/19, 00:17 - Sara: I want to include you!!1!1
10/20/19, 00:18 - Sara: Or you haven’t read the rest, or te end
10/20/19, 00:18 - Sara: I will tell you later my situation
10/20/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I read it all and I did understood it. It's just that the beginning seems most fitting
10/20/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe "ya estamos muertos"
10/20/19, 00:21 - Sara: Because you want us dead
10/20/19, 00:21 - Sara: I don’t want
10/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: Again, if you don’t want to open the door, just say it
10/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: So you ignore my feelings for you
10/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: Fuck, i’m hurt af
10/20/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: That makes two of us
10/20/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you thought you can eat a cake and still have it, doesn't really work that way unfortunately
10/20/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AtDnEC4zak
10/20/19, 03:45 - Sara: Maybe I don’t want the previous cake, but I’m proposing you cook a new one
10/20/19, 03:46 - Sara: But idk what is going on with you, why full of hate and resentfulness? Do I deserve that? Do you want to end up like this?
10/20/19, 03:47 - Sara: Do you want to live if your shell all your life because you are afraid of being hurt again?
10/20/19, 03:53 - Sara: Maybe you miss some pieces of information. That, since we were in Italy, I started to realise that without feelings I cannot go anywhere with people. And that sex is meaningless when there isn’t anything to proof.
10/20/19, 03:55 - Sara: Considering relationships again (trial and error method, but that is normal when you are young and you are learning about life?)
10/20/19, 03:56 - Sara: That since the last time we talked, I feel so sadness and empiness because I have strong feelings for you. That in Italy I was the happiest person in the world.
10/20/19, 03:56 - Sara: Everything is incertainty, nothing ia clear
10/20/19, 03:58 - Sara: But please, if you want to give up (in at least keeping touch) from the very beginning just tell me because I feel an asshole when I cry, I write and I think about a person who doesn’t give a fuck about me.
10/20/19, 03:58 - Sara: And is it not better to solve it?
10/20/19, 03:59 - Sara: I don’t recognize you, and that is sad
10/20/19, 04:00 - Sara: I would travel for you anywhere in the planet and you can only see me with eyes of rage
10/20/19, 04:02 - Sara: Nobody likes to be like this, at lesst I don’t like being in tension with one of the people I love the most
10/20/19, 04:02 - Sara: If you need your space to recover, It’s okay. I understand it. But I want to know your intentions.
10/20/19, 04:05 - Sara: God, i’m the one in Italy. You forgot so fast.
10/20/19, 04:06 - Sara: But I insist. I know that you have a lot inside and I want to know it. The good and the bad.
10/20/19, 04:07 - Sara: I hope I don’t lose faith because your indifference and lack of empathy is huge.
10/20/19, 04:10 - Sara: I repeat, but you think i’ll hurt you again
10/20/19, 04:11 - Sara: And if we completely lose contact, at least i would like to know that one of the most important people i’ve met considers me shit
10/20/19, 04:11 - Sara: Fair enough
10/21/19, 22:50 - Sara: Are you better?
10/21/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
10/21/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think my body decided to adjust to my mind
10/21/19, 22:51 - Sara: Are you sick?
10/21/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: For the last two days my back is hurting like motherf***
10/21/19, 22:51 - Sara: Why? Did you force it?
10/21/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue
10/21/19, 22:52 - Sara: How is your mind then?
10/21/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now that I think about it maybe the back pain is not so bad
10/21/19, 22:53 - Sara: 😕
10/21/19, 22:53 - Sara: Is the thesis going well?
10/21/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, a bit slowly, but going forward
10/21/19, 22:55 - Sara: You have plenty of time, so you shouldn’t worry
10/21/19, 22:55 - Sara: Do you normally go out?
10/21/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you ask?
10/21/19, 22:56 - Sara: I want to know that you are okay
10/21/19, 22:56 - Sara: Also because you were better when you were partying, and that is fine
10/21/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm haven't hanged myself yet so it's not so bad
10/21/19, 22:57 - Sara: Don’t say that
10/21/19, 22:57 - Sara: How can I help you?
10/21/19, 22:57 - Sara: I don’t like seeing you like that
10/21/19, 22:59 - Sara: And I don’t want to be a burden but the opposite
10/21/19, 23:00 - Sara: Or a reason of this situation
10/21/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: A little late for that, don't you think?
10/21/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Listen, I don't hate you, I really wish you well and I hope that you'll be happy
10/21/19, 23:01 - Sara: It’s never too late
10/21/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But seeing you still hurts
10/21/19, 23:02 - Sara: But I want to fix this and to help you
10/21/19, 23:02 - Sara: Why are you afraid of me?
10/21/19, 23:03 - Sara: I remember the moment in the airport as if it were yesterday
10/21/19, 23:04 - Sara: And I don’t know, there was the truth
10/21/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you know that a few days before I left Ghent I started planning visiting Spain on your birthday?
10/21/19, 23:05 - Sara: Really?
10/21/19, 23:05 - Sara: It would have been a blessing
10/21/19, 23:06 - Sara: Do you know that I want to visit you in summer?
10/21/19, 23:08 - Sara: And why have you said this to me?
10/21/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been thinking about that a few days ago
10/21/19, 23:11 - Sara: And why?
10/21/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just thinking how quickly I went from heaven to hell
10/21/19, 23:12 - Sara: Let me help you
10/21/19, 23:12 - Sara: I mean, what is in your mind?
10/21/19, 23:13 - Sara: And thinking, i’m the one who knows the better how to solve this
10/21/19, 23:13 - Sara: Also, i explained more or less my situation
10/21/19, 23:17 - Sara: And I think we want more or less the same
10/21/19, 23:19 - Sara: Idk if you have read it
10/21/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how is that?
10/21/19, 23:29 - Sara: I’m the guilty, right?
10/21/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You simply made a choice, it's not a crime
10/21/19, 23:31 - Sara: But then you are pushing me out of your life
10/21/19, 23:31 - Sara: When I have told you my situation
10/21/19, 23:31 - Sara: So idk
10/21/19, 23:34 - Sara: I want you in my life, I want to re-start as if it’s the first time
10/21/19, 23:36 - Sara: I don’t hate you, I haven’t replaced you
10/21/19, 23:40 - Sara: I’m explicitly telling you everything
10/22/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: You certainly talk a lot about about how you feel and what you want but you don't seem to pay much attention to what I've been telling you
10/22/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: You just keep pushing me
10/22/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: To get what you want
10/22/19, 00:01 - Sara: And you don’t want the same?
10/22/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Elaborate, please
10/22/19, 00:03 - Sara: Elaborate?
10/22/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: What it is that I want?
10/22/19, 00:06 - Sara: I know you have been telling me that you are hurt for what happened, to take time.
10/22/19, 00:07 - Sara: But I saw you in the airport crying before me leaving while you told me you wanted distance
10/22/19, 00:08 - Sara: We were holding hand, hugging, making love, kissing and you were the happiest person on planet earth (so did I)
10/22/19, 00:08 - Sara: You keep saying you don’t want to see me but you keep seeing my photos
10/22/19, 00:09 - Sara: You say I contradict myself when you are doing it
10/22/19, 00:10 - Sara: Like I feel like in march/april in Ghent, that I knew there was something between us but you were in a mess in your mind... so I had to fight for that and try to talk with you soo many times
10/22/19, 00:11 - Sara: I have said the truth, I don’t deny what I feel, I fight for keeping you... because probably you feel the same
10/22/19, 00:11 - Sara: That is why i am like this
10/22/19, 00:11 - Sara: Because I feel it
10/22/19, 00:12 - Sara: And I feel we can solve it, that our mental health can be good again
10/22/19, 00:13 - Sara: I don’t pretend going back to the last, but to make the present better
10/22/19, 00:13 - Sara: Heal the wounds, talk as adults
10/22/19, 00:14 - Sara: Knowing about you does me good
10/22/19, 00:15 - Sara: I know that you don’t let your emotions go out, i know that is difficult
10/22/19, 00:15 - Sara: That it’s hard the situation your living
10/22/19, 00:17 - Sara: You think that i’m better without you. In fact, nobody needs nobody, but i do want you to be in my life because you are great, i could see it in your eyes
10/22/19, 00:17 - Sara: And I think (or hope) you have the same vision of me
10/22/19, 00:20 - Sara: I don’t want to end bad (or end) with a person who was essential (and is essential) in a moment in my life and made me happy
10/22/19, 00:21 - Sara: I was so proud of you as a couple, and I’m still thinking that I’m lucky for meeting you and I’d like to be proud of you in anyway
10/22/19, 00:22 - Sara: I just want you to see the real me, not to push you.
10/22/19, 00:24 - Sara: Because we weren’t in a good moment of our lives (or we are), doesn’t mean that we cannot try even a friendship or see what happens
10/22/19, 00:25 - Sara: Incertainty kills me but it’s beautiful at the same time because we can shape it as we want
10/22/19, 00:27 - Sara: I exploded, okay. My situation in august was the worst of my life and I didn’t act as I should, but i’m a better version of me and ai want to fix this
10/22/19, 00:27 - Sara: I know that you have insecurities
10/22/19, 00:28 - Sara: “You are not worthy”, “live overcomes you”, “you don’t deserve happiness”, “she substituted you because you are shit”. I know also these. They suck.
10/22/19, 00:29 - Sara: And , as I told you, i want yo help and to say to those insecurities to fuck off. You are more than you think, believe me.
10/22/19, 00:31 - Sara: Yes, I want you to be happy and proud of yourself. I want us to be okay because I know that we met for something.
10/22/19, 00:31 - Sara: Tell me if I’m wrong
10/22/19, 00:32 - Sara: Love makes me do this. I’m not ashamed that I still love you.
10/22/19, 00:32 - Sara: That I have a force in my heart to say “go forth and don’t give up”
10/22/19, 00:33 - Sara: Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me that I wanna keep, they say
10/22/19, 00:35 - Sara: I’m moving heavens and earth as a motherf******** for this. Believe me when I say I still care.
10/22/19, 00:37 - Sara: And when you are rude (yes, you go to the deepest parts of not closed wounds), that kills me. Again, if I’m wrong and you hate me, tell me
10/22/19, 00:38 - Sara: I don’t like thinking about someone all day and crying for them if they don’t care neither.
10/22/19, 00:38 - Sara: I only ask if you still have it in any shape
10/22/19, 00:40 - Sara: I feel i have the power of this amd the capacity of solving this.
10/22/19, 00:41 - Sara: I hope this is elaborated enough, and also enough to be anwered
10/22/19, 00:43 - Sara: I don’t want you to be afraid, angry, sad, worried...etc, and not expressing it
10/22/19, 00:45 - Sara: I want for you the best in the universe
10/22/19, 00:46 - Sara: And if I could, i’d be in front of your door
10/22/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: My hopes and dreams regarding you died some time ago, I'm not joking when I tell you that it's painful to see you, please, let me go, that's all I'm asking
10/22/19, 14:13 - Sara: I cannot let you
10/22/19, 14:14 - Sara: We need to solve this
10/22/19, 14:14 - Sara: And I know we can
10/22/19, 14:15 - Sara: And I know there is something, not love maybe but something else
10/22/19, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: "If you love me let me go
And run away before I know"
10/22/19, 14:16 - Sara: What do you have against me?
10/22/19, 14:16 - Sara: I’m not showing you that I still care?
10/22/19, 14:17 - Sara: That’s for cowards
10/22/19, 14:18 - Sara: Why don’t you show yourself or talk? You always hide
10/22/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: There was a time when I felt comfortable opening up to you, but I no longer feel that way
10/22/19, 14:19 - Sara: And that’s mature?
10/22/19, 14:20 - Sara: That’s the way you treat a person you care? Or at least you did
10/22/19, 14:22 - Sara: This is the way you want to end? Seriously?
10/22/19, 14:24 - Sara: What have I done?
10/22/19, 14:26 - Sara: I haven’t done a crime, you said
10/22/19, 14:28 - Sara: And I deserve at least an opportunity
10/22/19, 14:28 - Sara: Maybe soon, later
10/22/19, 14:29 - Sara: But I don’t deserve this mental torture
10/22/19, 14:32 - Sara: Is that rencour?
10/22/19, 14:33 - Sara: I want to proof that you can trust me again
10/22/19, 14:35 - Sara: If, after the Italy trip, i disappear and I treat you like shit at least You’d like to know what happens
10/22/19, 14:42 - Sara: Ay least that
10/22/19, 14:56 - Sara: You are treating me like a criminal, dude
10/22/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, you keep pushing me to get what you want again, good job Christian
10/22/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I expressed myself a few times already and if by now you don't know what bothers me, than you probably never will
10/22/19, 15:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: The fact that you don't seem to remember much of what I say hurts too

10/22/19, 16:47 - Sara: This message was deleted
10/22/19, 16:47 - Sara: This message was deleted
10/22/19, 16:50 - Sara: Looking for old comversation with a different context to insult me
10/22/19, 16:50 - Sara: I don’t recognise you anymore
10/22/19, 16:50 - Sara: I remember it quite much, but I feel that we need to solve this
10/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: If you hate me, say it, for god sake
10/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: I told you a thousand times
10/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: You are behaving like an asshole
10/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: Taking things out of context
10/22/19, 16:52 - Sara: I don’t want to believe you changed that much
10/22/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just let me go, please...
10/22/19, 16:54 - Sara: 😞
10/22/19, 16:56 - Sara: If that is what you want...
10/22/19, 16:57 - Sara: Time is what we need
10/22/19, 16:57 - Sara: And well, it will say
10/22/19, 16:59 - Sara: I cannot do much
10/22/19, 16:59 - Sara: I’m sorry for everything
10/22/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Goodbye Sara, I genuinely hope that you will be happy and successful and that you will find love again
10/22/19, 17:03 - Sara: I have just lost it
10/22/19, 17:03 - Sara: I want for you the same
10/22/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdpY5fVFJg
10/22/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I've sent this before but it's more fitting now
10/22/19, 18:22 - Sara: Will you give me some day an explanation for all this?
10/22/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
10/22/19, 18:24 - Sara: I hope we solve this someday
10/22/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, perhaps I can try to explain something. Knowing you, you're probably going to take it as an attack on you, but whatever. Perhaps what hurt me the most were your priorities. You made your choice and you put sex higher than our relationship. Maybe at the moment you were in bad mental shape but I didn't see any change from that mindset in Italy and I don't really see it now. As I mentioned, not a crime, I accept it but I don't have to like it. It's just rather dissapointing. But I suppose it wasn't that different in Ghent, you were rather strongly opposed to a closed relationship, just at the time I accepted that because I didn't want to lose you. But it's not a sustainable way to live, so I'm not willing to do that anymore, it's an important lesson on self care I guess. And it's hard for me to see you as just a friend because I don't think we ever were just friends, for a short time I tried that in Ghent and it was horrible.
10/22/19, 20:51 - Sara: You haven’t read this
10/22/19, 20:52 - Sara: Or this
10/22/19, 20:53 - Sara: I have noticed changes since then, in fact.
10/22/19, 20:53 - Sara: Why was it hard for you to be friends?
10/22/19, 20:54 - Sara: Or even this. Thinking about relationships, I have learnt
10/22/19, 20:54 - Sara: If you want to forget about distance, it’s okay
10/22/19, 20:55 - Sara: If you say that I haven’t changed since Italy is because you don’t want to understand it
10/22/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Qué?
10/22/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mostly put it in rather confusing, and sometimes contradicting way, I'm just an engineer, I can read math not women
10/22/19, 20:57 - Sara: If you want to forget because there is distance in between, ai understand*
10/22/19, 20:58 - Sara: ?
10/22/19, 20:58 - Sara: Because I love you is arabic x)
10/22/19, 20:59 - Sara: Or everything I said was in Chinese
10/22/19, 21:00 - Sara: Maybe you don’t trust me, but just say it
10/22/19, 21:00 - Sara: But don’t say I’m confusing
10/22/19, 21:02 - Sara: And no, i didn’t consider it as an attack
10/22/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Trust is certainly an issue but the way you put your current mindset is not clear, you say that you're thinking, considering but nothing specific and put in such a way that it's kind of ambiguous
10/22/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Saraish is a lot worse than Chinese
10/22/19, 21:07 - Sara: I don’t doubt about my feelings. I’m thinking about the future because is uncertain.
10/22/19, 21:08 - Sara: Is that more clear?
10/22/19, 21:09 - Sara: I don’t want to end (bad) with you
10/22/19, 21:20 - Sara: Just ask me what is ambiguous
10/22/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said this:
10/22/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also this:
10/22/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: So which one is it?
10/22/19, 21:27 - Sara: The recent one is the one. However, that doesn’t mean that i’m still afraid of screw it up in any aspect
10/22/19, 21:27 - Sara: That idk how it could be, not only with you but in general
10/22/19, 21:28 - Sara: Fears are there, and can appear even when you don’t want
10/22/19, 21:30 - Sara: If I’m honest idk the situation with you, idk what is going to happen with Ricardo. Idk what about me neither. Again, uncertainty. And also fear of pushing things or screwing it up
10/22/19, 21:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ricardo?
10/22/19, 21:31 - Sara: I told you about him I think 🤔
10/22/19, 21:31 - Sara: I’m sure
10/22/19, 21:32 - Sara: He is a friend of mine
10/22/19, 21:33 - Sara: And well, again. I cannot foresee the future, but i’m able to modify it in some way
10/22/19, 21:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Talk to me honestly or not at all
10/22/19, 21:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your words imply something more
10/22/19, 21:38 - Sara: Okay, I’ll be honest
10/22/19, 21:42 - Sara: I have some feelings for him, but not love (that’s huge, i think it’s about time and trust). He is nice, I feel comfortable with him when we meet but we enjoy the present so we are not like “oh couple?”.And I hope he considers me a friend and not uses me.
10/22/19, 21:43 - Sara: About you, I still love you and I needed a back step to realize more about that. But i’m afraid of the distance, of probably trying again the relationahip and not knowing the reaction or consequences, of your right to treat me like shit when you are angry
10/22/19, 21:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I've seen that somewhere before, hmmm...
10/22/19, 21:44 - Sara: But my heart says to keep trying, because I’d stay in the week in Italy if I could. I really felt happy.
10/22/19, 21:44 - Sara: And...?
10/22/19, 21:44 - Sara: I want to know you more
10/22/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that was me and we both know how that ended
10/22/19, 21:45 - Sara: Mmmmm both of you are different
10/22/19, 21:45 - Sara: And the feelings I have for you are stronger
10/22/19, 21:46 - Sara: And that’s about taking care of a flower
10/22/19, 21:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how am I supposed to know that? The times when you said something and I just trusted your words without question are in the past
10/22/19, 21:47 - Sara: That’s up to you
10/22/19, 21:47 - Sara: I don’t know
10/22/19, 21:47 - Sara: I have been talking to you and trying to solve all this
10/22/19, 21:47 - Sara: I went to Italy with you
10/22/19, 21:48 - Sara: You still care
10/22/19, 21:48 - Sara: And what we built is something that remains
10/22/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And now be anxious about that you're meeting someone else and slowly developing feelings?
10/22/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said you don't deserve mental torture but neither do I
10/22/19, 21:49 - Sara: But
10/22/19, 21:50 - Sara: Every time I meet a person would you be anxious?
10/22/19, 21:50 - Sara: And again, for me it’s about planting a flower
10/22/19, 21:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a difference between just meeting friends and whatever you're doing
10/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: The gardener knows which one wants to grow more
10/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: In which way
10/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: Lack of trust
10/22/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I somehow doubt you have that much self control
10/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: Sorry?
10/22/19, 21:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really think that anybody does, tbh
10/22/19, 21:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Love is not a plant that you choose
10/22/19, 21:52 - Sara: Do I deserve you being offensive? What is the use of that?
10/22/19, 21:52 - Sara: Planting the seed is not a choice
10/22/19, 21:52 - Sara: Forget about it or not, it’s concioua
10/22/19, 21:52 - Sara: Concious
10/22/19, 21:54 - Sara: You can care a lot about a friend
10/22/19, 21:55 - Sara: But if that person treats you bad, doesn’t want to meet you, talk shit behind your back... you start realising that it’s not good for you
10/22/19, 21:55 - Sara: That’s the unconcious seed you have planted when you met them
10/22/19, 21:55 - Sara: But then you decide how much time, care and effort you take with the person
10/22/19, 21:56 - Sara: If they deserve it or not. If that plan dies or not, if it will have fruits or not
10/22/19, 21:57 - Sara: With a person I can talk the limits, I have already done it
10/22/19, 21:59 - Sara: There was a moment that I realized that I needed validation and self-esteem through sex with people I didn’t feel anything and didn’t feel like doing
10/22/19, 22:00 - Sara: Imagine that you have never received any compliment in your life and all of a sudden, you have people “behind you”. I had a feeling of pleasing incredible because “oh, they like me”
10/22/19, 22:00 - Sara: So yes... what i was going to say?
10/22/19, 22:00 - Sara: Oh yes, that I can put the limits
10/22/19, 22:00 - Sara: Basically
10/22/19, 22:00 - Sara: I’m not neither an irrational animal or a person who needs others to feel valuable
10/22/19, 22:01 - Sara: If that answers your question
10/22/19, 22:01 - Sara: And I planted my plants as I wanted
10/22/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: So now you have sex with people that you have feelings for, that's nice, actual improvement but doesn't really make it much better for our specific case
10/22/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's good that you improved like that, don't get me wrong
10/22/19, 22:02 - Sara: What does it better?
10/22/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I expressed my opinion on open relationships, but it doesn't matter, I'm not going to ask anything from you
10/22/19, 22:03 - Sara: Also explains my probably behaviour towards relationships
10/22/19, 22:03 - Sara: And changed a bit
10/22/19, 22:04 - Sara: I have learnt to love (independent of the manner) in a very beautiful way and meaningful
10/22/19, 22:04 - Sara: Even without being an affair or whatever
10/22/19, 22:04 - Sara: Again, now it’s about fear
10/22/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which means that I still cannot have anything stable with you
10/22/19, 22:06 - Sara: Probably not in general, but i don’t reject it.
10/22/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: So basically being friends without benefits? xd
10/22/19, 22:07 - Sara: Yes, but if I feel like I can do it. But it’s quite limited, I supoose
10/22/19, 22:08 - Sara: I don’t like sayinf it like that
10/22/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Excuse me, I think I misunderstood something?
10/22/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Isn't that just being regular friends?
10/22/19, 22:08 - Sara: With the people I consider friend, yes of course
10/22/19, 22:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: So how exactly is that limited?
10/22/19, 22:09 - Sara: If I feel like doing it with someone and i’m not in a relationahip, i won’t limit it if i realy mean it
10/22/19, 22:09 - Sara: Like the key for me is talking with people and letting clear everything
10/22/19, 22:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/22/19, 22:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: So if you were in a relationship, than you would limit yourself?
10/22/19, 22:10 - Sara: Nop
10/22/19, 22:10 - Sara: I’ll water my flowers in another way
10/22/19, 22:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: You just said that
10/22/19, 22:11 - Sara: Limit In the sense of i’m not in a closed relationship
10/22/19, 22:12 - Sara: That at the moment i have
To change something, i’ll talk
With people and change the way of watering them
10/22/19, 22:13 - Sara: I don’t deny thoughts and feelimgs
10/22/19, 22:13 - Sara: I just shape them as me and the other person please and are comfortable
10/22/19, 22:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: So the bottom line is still that
10/22/19, 22:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now it's at least clear
10/22/19, 22:15 - Sara: Define “still”, or when you want something stable
10/22/19, 22:15 - Sara: And what is anything 4 u?
10/22/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still, I mean after this additional explanation, the end result is the same
10/22/19, 22:16 - Sara: It has been though for me all
Of this, it’s about me getting stability
10/22/19, 22:17 - Sara: This topic has been an issue to get it
10/22/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, anything obviously being a relationship, I never wanted to break up, but well
10/22/19, 22:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure how your approach is getting you closer to stability but I hope it somehow works out for you
10/22/19, 22:18 - Sara: That you don’t hate me, avoiding me or insult me is helping
10/22/19, 22:18 - Sara: It’s just getting touch again
10/22/19, 22:20 - Sara: And I’m having you in my love someway and it can grow, so that gives me hope
10/22/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, from what I understood so far hypothetically we could get back together and at any moment you could change your mind again so that doesn't give me much hope because it's not a great way to live, in constant fear
10/22/19, 22:22 - Sara: I hope i don’t change my mind
10/22/19, 22:22 - Sara: But yep, nobody likes that
10/22/19, 22:22 - Sara: That is why i want to “wait” and see how everything goes with me, you and people
10/22/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, it's hard for me to even comprehend that if I were with someone one day I would just decide that I'm tired of the close relationship and would want out, sounds so unfair
10/22/19, 22:24 - Sara: And if a couple does not work, i want your friendship minimum
10/22/19, 22:24 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/22/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I find it hard to emphatize with some of your points, I guess I just work in a completely different way
10/22/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like if I'm happy with someone, I would never jeopardize it for an open relationship
10/22/19, 22:26 - Sara: I understand it in another manner now
10/22/19, 22:26 - Sara: I was completely afraid
10/22/19, 22:26 - Sara: And i didn’t get over Guada’s
Breakup, the surgery, feeling lonely etc
10/22/19, 22:26 - Sara: That didn’t help
10/22/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but I'm also referring to what you told me now
10/22/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because it doesn't suggest behavior like I just described
10/22/19, 22:29 - Sara: Well, I can have commitment with people
10/22/19, 22:29 - Sara: But for that i need to talk
10/22/19, 22:29 - Sara: Also this persective was in my mind recently
10/22/19, 22:30 - Sara: Not like i’ll change my mind but about establishing
10/22/19, 22:30 - Sara: Putting it into practice
10/22/19, 22:31 - Sara: Being in my comfortable zone in everything
10/22/19, 22:31 - Sara: Not playing with people
10/22/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: You asked me to give you a chance, I'll be honest, this wasn't very reassuring
10/22/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps I'm more afraid of you than before tbh
10/22/19, 22:39 - Sara: Why?
10/22/19, 22:40 - Sara: I’m considering the relationahip with you
10/22/19, 22:40 - Sara: I had been depressive these days, let me recover a lit of everything
10/22/19, 22:41 - Sara: To stabilise everything
10/22/19, 22:41 - Sara: Ia that weird?
10/22/19, 22:43 - Sara: Also it’s about us being progressive, i think
10/22/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
10/22/19, 22:44 - Sara: Stabilise this
10/22/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not
10/22/19, 22:54 - Sara: So yes, i’m really looking forward to establish again contact and see what happens
10/22/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not promising you anything, everything depends on you and your decisions, right now you are a risky investment
10/22/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm going to protect myself in the first place
10/22/19, 22:57 - Sara: Why putting on me all the responsability?
10/22/19, 22:58 - Sara: I don’t know what to think about that behaviour, but I understand it at the same time
10/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I never even wanted to break up in the first place and I defined myself quite precisely
10/22/19, 22:58 - Sara: But that makes me look like the devil
10/22/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply, I know what I want and I'm not sure at all if you do
10/22/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Considering your clothing choices...
10/22/19, 23:00 - Sara: Why I have the feeling i’m in the eye of the beholder
10/22/19, 23:00 - Sara: Looks like superiority towards me or something
10/22/19, 23:00 - Sara: I wwnt you to be my friend/couple... not my saviour
10/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Superiority?
10/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Savior? What?
10/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: Yes, idk. Those commenta were weird to me
10/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: This
10/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you have an equation and something is constant it's not going to change the result
10/22/19, 23:01 - Sara: This
10/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: This was a joke
10/22/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: About the clothes I mean
10/22/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply, from what you told me, you don't seem sure of anything
10/22/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I kind of feel like I am
10/22/19, 23:02 - Sara: I cannot be sure of the future
10/22/19, 23:02 - Sara: I’m sure of what I feel
10/22/19, 23:04 - Sara: I’m in a weird period
10/22/19, 23:04 - Sara: I expected something like ‘’me too” or something
10/22/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: From my perspective everything depends mostly on you simply because I kind of already have a set mindset
10/22/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps later if it goes well, now I'm rather nervous about all of this
10/22/19, 23:05 - Sara: I understand this
10/22/19, 23:05 - Sara: And this
10/22/19, 23:05 - Sara: Don’t worry
10/22/19, 23:05 - Sara: Don’t force anything
10/22/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's all I meant, nothing of this superiority, savior shit
10/22/19, 23:06 - Sara: Okay
10/22/19, 23:06 - Sara: I felt like i’ll be judged in a matter of seconds
10/22/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we're certainly on thin ice, not gonna lie
10/22/19, 23:07 - Sara: Why do you feel it like that?
10/22/19, 23:07 - Sara: Do you think we can end up worse?
10/22/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
10/22/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, starting point is being nothing whatsoever so I guess not
10/22/19, 23:09 - Sara: As well
10/22/19, 23:09 - Sara: But that, at least, hurted me
10/22/19, 23:12 - Sara: Thanks for understanding my situation
10/22/19, 23:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/22/19, 23:16 - Sara: What that makes you think?
10/22/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it's kind of a part of being in a relationship, I want my partner to feel special and I want to feel special too
10/22/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Close friendship too
10/22/19, 23:18 - Sara: What makes you feel special?
10/22/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I still have to figure that out, but probably being physically close is one of those things
10/22/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And many emotional things that I would have to figure out how to name
10/22/19, 23:20 - Sara: Can I give you that?
10/22/19, 23:20 - Sara: Understandable, you’ll find out
10/22/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, it's one of the reasons I don't like open relationships, it robs me of part of that special feeling
10/22/19, 23:22 - Sara: Like hugs, kisses, sex?
10/22/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, hugs not, I'm not going to deny hugs to anybody
10/22/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe depends on what kind of hugs
10/22/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rest yes
10/22/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also more
10/22/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sleeping together, cuddling
10/22/19, 23:24 - Sara: Which ones?
10/22/19, 23:24 - Sara: Denying everything?
10/22/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think I hug friends differently than my partner but I'm not sure, I guess it's subtle
10/22/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everything?
10/22/19, 23:25 - Sara: What you said i mean
10/22/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Things I personally consider intimate
10/22/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to cuddle with anybody else if I'm with someone
10/22/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I probably like that more than sex tbh, the cuddling I mean
10/22/19, 23:28 - Sara: Agree
10/22/19, 23:28 - Sara: And what would to expect from me?
10/22/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, what I described is basically a regular, closed relationship I think, no?
10/22/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's pretty much what I've been saying from the beginning so nothing new
10/22/19, 23:30 - Sara: Sex, sleeping together, cuddling, kiss?
10/22/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want to make a list?
10/22/19, 23:31 - Sara: 🤨
10/22/19, 23:31 - Sara: do you hae any problem if I have to “list” things?
10/22/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't understand what are you asking me about here?
10/22/19, 23:31 - Sara: I want to know and also came out in the conversation
10/22/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: So pretty much that, it's rather self explanatory
10/22/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have any special points to make here
10/22/19, 23:33 - Sara: It’s about individuality
10/22/19, 23:33 - Sara: Everyone can determine what is intimate
10/22/19, 23:33 - Sara: That’s why I asked
10/22/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, so what you said pretty much, I think
10/22/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I get it, some people I know would also consider dancing for example
10/22/19, 23:34 - Sara: Sleeping together and cuddling? In what sense? Maybe you consider me crazy, but I want to know
10/22/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't
10/22/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, like you typically sleep with a partner, I don't know about you but I don't typically sleep with my friends
10/22/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't cuddle with people I don't care about
10/22/19, 23:36 - Sara: Well, sleep sleep yes... with friends sharing a room
10/22/19, 23:36 - Sara: But spoon, hug?
10/22/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I just thought about that, that's fine
10/22/19, 23:37 - Sara: Or even bed but idk
10/22/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think any kind, at least for me it implies something closer I guess
10/22/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, yes, like in Pula with Cristina, that's fine, yes
10/22/19, 23:37 - Sara: As that’ts not about the feelings rather than the actions?
10/22/19, 23:38 - Sara: Stealing the blanket xd
10/22/19, 23:38 - Sara: I’m just asking
10/22/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you cuddle? xd
10/22/19, 23:39 - Sara: Mmmmm no i think
10/22/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure what's your point here
10/22/19, 23:39 - Sara: I didn’t have feelings towards her
10/22/19, 23:39 - Sara: Just know
10/22/19, 23:40 - Sara: Is there any problem?
10/22/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, I got a vibe that these questions could be somewhat malicious
10/22/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I guess I was wrong
10/22/19, 23:41 - Sara: Why malicious?
10/22/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, that you would get to some sort of mean point at the end
10/22/19, 23:41 - Sara: I just want to know the limitations i’d have if i’m with you
10/22/19, 23:42 - Sara: Just have a different perspective, but I wanted to know yours
10/22/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty standard, I think
10/22/19, 23:42 - Sara: Call it limitations, call it X
10/22/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: From my perspective I don't need to be asked to not do certain things, I'm just not going to do them to not make my partner sad or anxious, for me it's not really something that needs to be said
10/22/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although there may be some things that need to be clarified, I guess
10/22/19, 23:44 - Sara: You can do them if you feel like and you talk it, I guess
10/22/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only if someone is really, really, really fine with something
10/22/19, 23:45 - Sara: You said it x)
10/22/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: If they agree to it only out of fear that if they don't they will lose the other person it's just cruel
10/22/19, 23:46 - Sara: I didn’t understand this
10/22/19, 23:47 - Sara: Like the syntax and the stuff
10/22/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Back to the topic of open relationships I guess, but it's the example I've read about somewhere
10/22/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a couple and one person after some time asks to make it an open relationship
10/22/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: The other person agrees, but not because they actually want it
10/22/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: But because they are afraid that otherwise their partner will just leave them
10/22/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is not a personal attack on you, it's a pretty common thing actually
10/22/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I could've used some commas xd
10/22/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: r/relationship_advice for the win xd
10/22/19, 23:57 - Sara: Happened to me twice
10/22/19, 23:57 - Sara: Yes, understandable
10/22/19, 23:58 - Sara: If they agree to it ,only out of fear, 
that if they don't they will lose the other person, it's just cruel
10/22/19, 23:58 - Sara: Better haha
10/22/19, 23:58 - Sara: So yes
10/22/19, 23:58 - Sara: I’ll think about what you said
10/22/19, 23:59 - Sara: It can be weird for me i think, idk
10/23/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think I was making it pretty clear from the start that open relationship is a no go for me, so nothing new
10/23/19, 00:00 - Sara: Yes, i know
10/23/19, 00:00 - Sara: Can i ask why physical touch has to be excluisive? I’m trying to understad it
10/23/19, 00:00 - Sara: Not evil, rude
10/23/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not just any physical touch
10/23/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Specifically romantic physical touch
10/23/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not sure if romantic is the right word, but you get the point
10/23/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: And we've already been discussing the open relationships a few times so it's pretty much the same
10/23/19, 00:03 - Sara: Mmmm true
10/23/19, 00:03 - Sara: A special touch with the other?
10/23/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how to call it, tbh
10/23/19, 00:04 - Sara: Mmmm but is that not unique?
10/23/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is unique?
10/23/19, 00:05 - Sara: What you have between you and another person
10/23/19, 00:06 - Sara: I don’t want to be the flower girl 😂
10/23/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not that unique, at least not for me
10/23/19, 00:07 - Sara: Tell me
10/23/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I'm going to have sexual relations with a few people at the same time it doesn't feel special to me at all, for example
10/23/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, it's going to be a bit different with everyone
10/23/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: But doesn't feel special at all
10/23/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm saying that because I did that in Ghent
10/23/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I know how I felt
10/23/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that I felt much better once I was only with you
10/23/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Physically, the same, mentally, not comparable at all
10/23/19, 00:11 - Sara: I agree, it’s completely different
10/23/19, 00:12 - Sara: But i’m getting a lit anxious thinking about the lack of physical touch
10/23/19, 00:12 - Sara: Not sex, but idk “cuddling” (for me there are different kinds)
10/23/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I'm assuming that distance is going to be a large problem, unfortunately
10/23/19, 00:14 - Sara: And that does not change a thing?
10/23/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, but you don't have to agree to anything
10/23/19, 00:16 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/23/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not asking anything from you, you can make your choice however it fits you
10/23/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And we'll just go our separate ways, without hate or anger
10/23/19, 00:17 - Sara: But separate ways
10/23/19, 00:18 - Sara: Nothing in betweet as friendship
10/23/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least for a time, I mentioned my problem with friendship before
10/23/19, 00:20 - Sara: True, i remember
10/23/19, 00:20 - Sara: Just to make sure
10/23/19, 00:21 - Sara: Okay, we will be seeing this
10/23/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like I'm making a sales pitch
10/23/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: And my product is not very good
10/23/19, 00:23 - Sara: It’s just talking
10/23/19, 00:23 - Sara: It’s about time
10/23/19, 00:23 - Sara: The first thought was this
10/23/19, 00:24 - Sara: But I want to see how everything goes
10/23/19, 00:24 - Sara: Not making mine?
10/23/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, also
10/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: Okay
10/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: Can we talk tomorrow? Tomorrow I have to wake up early
10/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: And well, i’m not a big fan of zombies
10/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure
10/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: XD
10/23/19, 00:26 - Sara: Merci beacoup!
10/23/19, 00:26 - Sara: Have a good night!
10/23/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenas noches
10/23/19, 00:26 - Sara: Ad if you need something or need to share something just tell me 😊
10/23/19, 00:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/23/19, 00:28 - Sara: 😂
10/23/19, 20:29 - Sara: Hey!
10/23/19, 20:29 - Sara: Okay, I think I'll try to write it now in a very short way  (because I think my vision has been said)
10/23/19, 20:30 - Sara: I feel mental/emotional tiredness after all this situation with you. I have been suffering a lot recently so I literally feel as i have been running a marathon. For that reason, I need my time to ''recover''
10/23/19, 20:32 - Sara: It is also time to see how this happen, everything around me in general. Again, I'm afraid you having changed because all the perception I have of you is harmful and rude. I hope it was because of pain or other kind of fellings related to this one, but anyway I want to see who is the real you in this situation.
10/23/19, 20:33 - Sara: If I take a step, in any sort of decisions, I want to be quite determined and sure. That will take my time as well to stabilise everything and see what is going on now, idk how much (I expect not too long).
10/23/19, 20:34 - Sara: For me this is going to be about constructing the building again, and feeling comfortable and in a trust-worthy environment
10/23/19, 20:35 - Sara: About my ''sales pitch''... well, I'm a person who considers that if someone decides to be with me in any type of relationship is because that person considers me important
10/23/19, 20:35 - Sara: I don't need to feel special, rather loved and that people take care of me. That is why i don't care what you do if I'm always informed.
10/23/19, 20:36 - Sara: I'm a little bit more independent than before, but everybody is (for me this is new)
10/23/19, 20:38 - Sara: And well.... I need physical contact too. Maybe I'm kind of 'skeptical'' (is that the word?) about the 'touch' with others. I like hugging, I like cuddling...and idk, because I'm in a couple doesn't mean that I'll change my perception about others. Of course, I'll respect my partner and their decisions (in any kind of relationsip) but It's also about others respecting my personality and my way of behaving with people. So I'd talk about that.
10/23/19, 20:39 - Sara: That is my general situation, I think.
10/23/19, 20:40 - Sara: I don't know if something can be misunderstood
10/23/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you yesterday that I'm thinking about myself a bit more now and that I'm not going to get into something that I don't feel comfortable with. In the end relationships should make us feel good and that's quite important to me. And the same applies to you. I've tried to make myself as clear as possible yesterday so you can judge it for yourself, if it's something that you're not comfortable with then you obviously shouldn't agree either and that's fine, we seem to have a significantly different approaches and if they don't fit, then well, it wouldn't work out anyway in the long term. I respect your view and I'm not going to try to change it in any way. I hope for the same respect from you.
10/23/19, 20:43 - Sara: Well, I was doing it as well
10/23/19, 20:43 - Sara: But I don’t know, agreements are about two people
10/23/19, 20:43 - Sara: Not being that solid
10/23/19, 20:45 - Sara: Always respecting the othe obv
10/23/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I honestly don't have much hope, maybe it could work if we lived in the same place again but at the moment I don't really see that happening any time soon (although I would like to)
10/23/19, 20:46 - Sara: So?
10/23/19, 20:47 - Sara: I’d wait a lit
10/23/19, 20:47 - Sara: Because everything is blur
10/23/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't know, we can discuss a bit but I'm just not getting my hopes up
10/23/19, 20:47 - Sara: With that optimism is difficult, but okay
10/23/19, 20:48 - Sara: What should we discuss?
10/23/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant in general, right now, idk
10/23/19, 20:48 - Sara: I refer if there is any topic or something
10/23/19, 20:48 - Sara: Or you refer about us?
10/23/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Us, like somehow organizing it
10/23/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's probably for later
10/23/19, 20:49 - Sara: Yes
10/23/19, 20:50 - Sara: I’d see what’s going between us
10/23/19, 20:50 - Sara: I don’t want to have a fake/ideal vision about you, and probably you the same about me
10/23/19, 20:50 - Sara: So I’d start having contact little by little again
10/23/19, 20:51 - Sara: It has been rough times for us, and maybe we have changed
10/23/19, 20:53 - Sara: Or what do you think?
10/23/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if I changed fundamentally, I don't think so, but my view of you is certainly not as wonderful as it used to be
10/23/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it can be rebuilt
10/23/19, 20:55 - Sara: Wonderful?
10/23/19, 20:55 - Sara: Yes, you can see who I am now
10/23/19, 20:55 - Sara: I don’t know if I have changed, maybe my vision is different about most of the stuff
10/23/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if that idiom is also in english but in polish we say that when you're in love you see everything through pink glasses
10/23/19, 20:57 - Sara: Yes, I understand the idea. I think we say that here.
10/23/19, 20:57 - Sara: But yes, understandable
10/23/19, 20:57 - Sara: Many stuff have happened
10/23/19, 20:57 - Sara: And I expected that
10/23/19, 20:58 - Sara: It’s natural I suppose
10/23/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm afraid that this is like braking a vase or something, you can put the pieces together but it's never going to be as good as before
10/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: From me, i don’t think is about going to the past
10/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: But about doing something different and worthy in the present/future
10/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: Idk how you see it
10/23/19, 21:05 - Sara: The past made us being like this
10/23/19, 21:06 - Sara: And I’m not the same Sara. Maybe worse or better, slightly different maybe
10/23/19, 21:07 - Sara: For me it’s about creating a new vase more adapted to us
10/23/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I liked the old vase...
10/23/19, 21:09 - Sara: Everything?
10/23/19, 21:09 - Sara: I don’t think so
10/23/19, 21:10 - Sara: I first think about you feeling not enough during the relationship, for instance
10/23/19, 21:10 - Sara: Idk, it is not like the rest is not valuable
10/23/19, 21:10 - Sara: But i believe in things can constantly be improved
10/23/19, 21:11 - Sara: Idk if you get my point
10/23/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that can be better now?
10/23/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think I can be enough if I'm not even in the same country
10/23/19, 21:12 - Sara: Define being enough
10/23/19, 21:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for most of our time together the most obvious point here was the physical not enough
10/23/19, 21:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And since at a distance there is no physical connection at all, which is important to you, I cannot do much
10/23/19, 21:14 - Sara: It’s not important for you neither?
10/23/19, 21:14 - Sara: I mean, physical contact. I can live without sex
10/23/19, 21:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is but I can live without it
10/23/19, 21:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Specific person is more important to me
10/23/19, 21:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rather than the touch itself
10/23/19, 21:16 - Sara: But idk, being hug by someone is meaninful to me in every aspect
10/23/19, 21:16 - Sara: And idk why is that harmful
10/23/19, 21:16 - Sara: Or lying with someone
10/23/19, 21:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't have anything against hugs
10/23/19, 21:17 - Sara: But cuddles, for me that is hugging lain down
10/23/19, 21:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you would want to go to a friend's house and sleep with them and cuddle?
10/23/19, 21:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't feel the same as hugging to me at all
10/23/19, 21:20 - Sara: I think the cuddle is the key
10/23/19, 21:20 - Sara: Why? Different feelings?
10/23/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for me cuddling is far more intimate
10/23/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Regular hugging with friends is just something that happens all the time, to greet, to say goodbye, to help when they feel bad, etc.
10/23/19, 21:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: But in bed, I would do that only if I had some feelings for the other person
10/23/19, 21:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's just my point of view, you obviously seem to see it differently
10/23/19, 21:23 - Sara: Partially yes
10/23/19, 21:23 - Sara: I can feel trust feelings, and I won’t deny it
10/23/19, 21:24 - Sara: Or feelings towards others, even if they are different
10/23/19, 21:25 - Sara: Like I don’t need to be in love to be like that with that person but trust, i think?
10/23/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if I'm in a relationship I personally reserve cuddling only for my partner
10/23/19, 21:26 - Sara: Like when someone is in love, the dedication for the partner is bigger
10/23/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same arguments as with the open relationships
10/23/19, 21:26 - Sara: Understandable
10/23/19, 21:27 - Sara: Not about open relationships but about my thoughts
10/23/19, 21:27 - Sara: I don’t know, my mind is not like a strict pyramid
10/23/19, 21:28 - Sara: Like I don’t see physical touch the only way to make special the other but the time spent with that person, the feelings or the trust
10/23/19, 21:28 - Sara: But again, my vision is blur at the moment. I haven’t talked with peope. I’m still hurt and I need some time to stabilise everything
10/23/19, 21:29 - Sara: I’m just afraid of feeling culprit for every affectional sign I do x)
10/23/19, 21:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in the simplest terms, I'm not particularly comfortable with my partner (whoever that would be) meeting with their friends to sleep with them
10/23/19, 21:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it's a particularly unusual point of view
10/23/19, 21:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: But again, I respect your point of view
10/23/19, 21:29 - Sara: I’d be weird
10/23/19, 21:30 - Sara: I’ll try to explain myself later
10/23/19, 21:31 - Sara: Maybe i’m nt expressing myself good enough
10/23/19, 21:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: What I described here is how I understood it, how else do you end up in bed with someone if you don't plan to have sex?
10/23/19, 21:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Aside from traveling or something of that sort
10/23/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or being in a relationship as well
10/23/19, 21:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not judging or anything, I could use a clarification
10/23/19, 23:25 - Sara: Beds are for lying as well
10/23/19, 23:25 - Sara: Like if you refer to a bed itself
10/23/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's still kind of hard to imagine, like how does that even come up in a conversation "would you like to go to bed and cuddle and nothing else?"
10/23/19, 23:28 - Sara: 😂 not like that
10/23/19, 23:28 - Sara: I imagine it lie watching a film or something
10/23/19, 23:28 - Sara: But cuddle for cuddle... except if you are sad
10/23/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite romantic
10/23/19, 23:30 - Sara: Mmmmm i don’t think so
10/23/19, 23:31 - Sara: Like it can be the typical image of a couple
10/23/19, 23:31 - Sara: But i don’t know, i can put my head on people’s leg for instance and it’s not romantic or sexual
10/23/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I wouldn't really call that cuddling
10/23/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't have any issues with that example
10/23/19, 23:33 - Sara: Put you arm in the other?
10/23/19, 23:33 - Sara: Like in all of thee i don’t know what is the limit
10/23/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you were asking me for specifics yesterday so I will also ask you to be more specific with this
10/23/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably hugging or spooning for the whole movie is a bit much
10/23/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: That I would call cuddling
10/23/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I should check the actual definition, now I'm curious
10/23/19, 23:37 - Sara: Mmmm hug or rather put your arm in the other’s chest, idk
10/23/19, 23:37 - Sara: Is it about time?
10/23/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
10/23/19, 23:38 - Sara: Which one is it? I’m curious too
10/23/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cuddling - hold close in one's arms as a way of showing love or affection.
10/23/19, 23:39 - Sara: Mmmmm
10/23/19, 23:39 - Sara: That’s not a hug?
10/23/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that was the first thing that showed up
10/23/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hug does count I guess
10/23/19, 23:40 - Sara: Mmmm that seems ambiguous
10/23/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me, I will hug a lot of people, but holding someone in my arms for a longer time (like a whole movie for example) probably only with my partner
10/23/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that
10/23/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it shows affection
10/23/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I like that, not gonna lie
10/23/19, 23:41 - Sara: Who doesn’t?
10/23/19, 23:42 - Sara: Both giving it and receiving it
10/23/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-cuddle
10/23/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are even different positions, nice xd
10/23/19, 23:43 - Sara: I see
10/23/19, 23:43 - Sara: But some of then are more friendly than others, idk
10/23/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can give you the numbers of the ones I personally reserve for a partner
10/23/19, 23:44 - Sara: But they are pretty nice
10/23/19, 23:44 - Sara: Tell me
10/23/19, 23:44 - Sara: And you expect from the other right?
10/23/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes
10/23/19, 23:45 - Sara: Like “orbid?
10/23/19, 23:45 - Sara: Forbid*
10/23/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: 1,2,4,9
10/23/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe 5, not sure
10/23/19, 23:47 - Sara: Seems reasonable
10/23/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not trying to ban all physical contact, that would be ridiculous but I have my boundaries
10/23/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's all
10/23/19, 23:48 - Sara: Mmmmm what do you mean my boundaries? I don’t get it from the context
10/23/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like what kind of cuddling is fine and which is not for example
10/23/19, 23:49 - Sara: Okay, i understand
10/23/19, 23:49 - Sara: Like I don’t know
10/23/19, 23:50 - Sara: Like I doubt about if that it’s because you don’t like the other person doing it or it is because it’s consider... infidelity? I don’t know if I explained myself
10/23/19, 23:50 - Sara: Like maybe i don’t like something but that doesn’t mean that the other person is betraying me
10/23/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not asking you to do anything, you asked, I'm being transparent about what I'm comfortable with and what I'm not, you can do whatever you want with these informations
10/23/19, 23:52 - Sara: Yes and no, I mean...
10/23/19, 23:52 - Sara: There must be agreements, although at the moment this is just information
10/23/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Neither of us is obligated to do anything
10/23/19, 23:53 - Sara: No, of course
10/23/19, 23:53 - Sara: But like again
10/23/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are the reasons that important?
10/23/19, 23:54 - Sara: If the reasons are what determines an infidelity, yes
10/23/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm simply not comfortable with certain things, it has to do with that special feeling I mentioned yesterday and probably some fears too
10/23/19, 23:57 - Sara: Understandable
10/23/19, 23:57 - Sara: I’m thinking that, in my case, it’s essential that a person has trust in me and contacta with me when there is any little problem
10/23/19, 23:57 - Sara: Like communication for me is the key
10/23/19, 23:57 - Sara: I really get upset when I’m informed by third parties about something
10/23/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, obviously, without trust I'm not even discussing anything regarding a relationship
10/23/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can't have a relationship without trust because even if I can agree to something with someone I would still constantly think they wouldn't respect that agreement and just lie to me
10/23/19, 23:59 - Sara: Understandable
10/24/19, 00:00 - Sara: Seems obvious but idk, many people are afraid to communicate
10/24/19, 00:03 - Sara: But again, agreements are for later
10/24/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: You asked, you got an answer, I hope that I made everything clear, more or less
10/24/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 00:07 - Sara: 💪
10/24/19, 00:07 - Sara: I hope things get better
10/24/19, 00:07 - Sara: Yes, more or less
10/24/19, 00:07 - Sara: And what is the important feature in a relationship for you?
10/24/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: One, single most important thing (that is actually quite complex and there are many things that affect it) is that I has to make me happy
10/24/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's probably like with almost everything in life, I guess
10/24/19, 00:10 - Sara: Yes
10/24/19, 00:10 - Sara: If something makes you more sad than happy, it’s not good for you
10/24/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of the things that affect it, well, the physical aspects that we've been discussing, or more in general, being comfortable but also feeling that I'm important for the other person, that they care and that I can feel safe with them
10/24/19, 00:13 - Sara: Safe from suffering I guess
10/24/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: And all of that reciprocated, obviously
10/24/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: If everything else gets shitty, I want to have someone that will support me, it's easy to be together when everything is perfect
10/24/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Much harder when it's not so perfect
10/24/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: In life I mean
10/24/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like job etc.
10/24/19, 00:15 - Sara: Job is a bas thing?
10/24/19, 00:15 - Sara: Bad*
10/24/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I mean in case something bad happens, like losing a job, or I don't know, some sort of illness or other problem
10/24/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's a true test if a relationship is good or not
10/24/19, 00:17 - Sara: Understandable
10/24/19, 00:17 - Sara: Would we pass the exam?
10/24/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we failed already
10/24/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you said you want something new, so maybe we'll see
10/24/19, 00:19 - Sara: Yes, of course
10/24/19, 00:19 - Sara: I don’t know if you are rencorous now
10/24/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I'm not
10/24/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I wasn't that supportive in your hard moments and you weren't in mine, I acknowledge the failure , it happened and well, hopefully it will be a lesson for the future
10/24/19, 00:21 - Sara: I agree, what doesn’t kill you make you stronger, they say
10/24/19, 00:21 - Sara: And why all that behaviour towards me? If I can ask
10/24/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which one exactly?
10/24/19, 00:22 - Sara: All the one you has after the trip
10/24/19, 00:23 - Sara: Maybe especially the last week
10/24/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
10/24/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dissapointment, loneliness, many negative feelings
10/24/19, 00:24 - Sara: Okay
10/24/19, 00:24 - Sara: But please
10/24/19, 00:24 - Sara: Don’t do that again
10/24/19, 00:24 - Sara: I didn’t deserve the hate you gave me
10/24/19, 00:24 - Sara: At least don’t do it to others
10/24/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, I won't, at least I'll try
10/24/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes the pain can be overwhelming
10/24/19, 00:26 - Sara: I know
10/24/19, 00:26 - Sara: But that is not an excuse
10/24/19, 00:27 - Sara: I don’t know
10/24/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not excusing myself
10/24/19, 00:27 - Sara: I understand you, because I was also like that when I was afraid
10/24/19, 00:27 - Sara: But... i just want to let you know how I felt for that
10/24/19, 00:28 - Sara: I wanted to know the reason
10/24/19, 00:28 - Sara: But man... don’t involve other people in my life, please
10/24/19, 00:28 - Sara: That is what I ask you to have contact again
10/24/19, 00:28 - Sara: Just respect
10/24/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I realize my mistakes and I apologize
10/24/19, 00:31 - Sara: But seriously? Or because I said it?
10/24/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seriously, but that's up to you if you believe me or not
10/24/19, 00:31 - Sara: I believe you
10/24/19, 00:32 - Sara: What made you change your conception in the conversation?
10/24/19, 00:32 - Sara: I notices a complete shift
10/24/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I intended to just give you the explanation because it just felt like something I should do and end at that
10/24/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe after all the negative emotions got out I just have a bit more clarity in mind, idk
10/24/19, 00:34 - Sara: Probably
10/24/19, 00:34 - Sara: That happened to me
10/24/19, 00:35 - Sara: They were gone just by talking
10/24/19, 00:35 - Sara: That is why I insisted
10/24/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least I can try to clarify everything and get more information before I decide to stay or leave
10/24/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Feels like a reasonable thing to do
10/24/19, 00:36 - Sara: The end seems dramatic
10/24/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Referring to that
10/24/19, 00:37 - Sara: I understand
10/24/19, 00:37 - Sara: I hope we never lose contact, tbh
10/24/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Off-topic, Erasmus job offers in Spain are quite mediocre, I guess if I ever want to go there I will need to learn Spanish
10/24/19, 00:41 - Sara: Why mediocre?
10/24/19, 00:41 - Sara: Well, it’s Spain xd
10/24/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing interesting, most of them unpaid
10/24/19, 00:41 - Sara: Not surprising
10/24/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will have to take a look at the local websites
10/24/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: But for that I would almost certainly need to know Spanish
10/24/19, 00:42 - Sara: If you find difficulties translating them, tell me
10/24/19, 00:42 - Sara: You know a bit
10/24/19, 00:42 - Sara: And how is your future going? Anything planned?
10/24/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Translating is not a problem, it's just that in Erasmus offers they don't necessarily require Spanish, English is often enough
10/24/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But in regular offers that's not the case
10/24/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, still working on the thesis
10/24/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm checking the offers for internships abroad, sometimes new ones appear
10/24/19, 00:44 - Sara: You prefee regular or erasmus?
10/24/19, 00:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I find something nice, I'll try to go, if not I'll try to find something in Poland
10/24/19, 00:45 - Sara: That is nice
10/24/19, 00:45 - Sara: Understandable
10/24/19, 00:45 - Sara: I hope you find something soon
10/24/19, 00:45 - Sara: Living in Poland is an option again?
10/24/19, 00:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: With Erasmus I could go abroad now, with regular probably not immediately
10/24/19, 00:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least for a time
10/24/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can just move out from the family house it will be enough for the start
10/24/19, 00:46 - Sara: Definitely a big step
10/24/19, 00:47 - Sara: Little by little ^^
10/24/19, 00:47 - Sara: Now i’m kind of understand you or Cristina about the “what the fuck i’m going to do next”
10/24/19, 00:47 - Sara: Ugh xD
10/24/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
10/24/19, 00:49 - Sara: I’m partially interested in doing a master of education ans then the erasmus internship, but idk if beinga teacher would limit me
10/24/19, 00:49 - Sara: But i want to do the internship abroad
10/24/19, 00:49 - Sara: Or to do a “year off” to approach to  study sexual education and doing voluntary work on that
10/24/19, 00:50 - Sara: It’s a weird feeling i’d have in the second semester xd
10/24/19, 00:50 - Sara: More xD
10/24/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Understandable
10/24/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a very weird feeling
10/24/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel like a real adult yet
10/24/19, 00:51 - Sara: Nobody is ready to be one
10/24/19, 00:52 - Sara: To live indepenent, have a job..?
10/24/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pretty much
10/24/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: My cousin who is like 20 days younger than me started planning his wedding xd
10/24/19, 00:53 - Sara: I’m so sorry for hij
10/24/19, 00:53 - Sara: Him*
10/24/19, 00:53 - Sara: x)
10/24/19, 00:53 - Sara: Well

10/24/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: He is planning it over a year ahead, I don't even know what I'm going to do next week
10/24/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mind blowing
10/24/19, 00:55 - Sara: Or tomorrow
10/24/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also

10/24/19, 00:56 - Sara: Hahaha
10/24/19, 00:56 - Sara: Well, people are different
10/24/19, 00:57 - Sara: And i’m sure we will know what would happen soon
10/24/19, 00:57 - Sara: That doesn’t make us less or something
10/24/19, 00:57 - Sara: I’ll go to sleep!
10/24/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel bad about it, it's just odd
10/24/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenas noches

10/24/19, 15:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: You started it or just joined?

10/24/19, 16:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ay Paco, un hombre con un carácter explosivo 💣
10/24/19, 16:29 - Sara: It’s funny because he lost a testicle, in think, in a battle

10/24/19, 16:53 - Sara: I feel proud of my babes
10/24/19, 16:54 - Sara: Or maybe you still keeping secrets 🙄
10/24/19, 16:55 - Sara: I remember you not having imagination or visual memories
10/24/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I have some visual reminders
10/24/19, 16:56 - Sara: How dare you not to remember the most beautiful thing in the world
10/24/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 16:59 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 16:59 - Sara: That is exciting
10/24/19, 16:59 - Sara: Because you don’t remember, you get excited for eveything as in the first time
10/24/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, so who are you again?
10/24/19, 17:01 - Sara: I’m your leader
10/24/19, 17:01 - Sara: With sleepy face and nice boobs
10/24/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, ok, but I don't believe you about the niceness of your boobs
10/24/19, 17:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to judge it by myself
10/24/19, 17:04 - Sara: You remembered so nicely
10/24/19, 17:05 - Sara: 😛
10/24/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot of time has passed, now they can be somewhere around your knees
10/24/19, 17:06 - Sara: I’m older
10/24/19, 17:06 - Sara: That’s true
10/24/19, 17:06 - Sara: Being 21 is hard
10/24/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🧓🏻
10/24/19, 17:09 - Sara: So are you
10/24/19, 17:09 - Sara: Well...
10/24/19, 17:09 - Sara: 💀
10/24/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least something to be happy about
10/24/19, 17:10 - Sara: Being older than me?
10/24/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Being almost dead
10/24/19, 17:11 - Sara: But still alive
10/24/19, 17:11 - Sara: Deal with it
10/24/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
10/24/19, 17:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 17:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/24/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: One thing I would like to ask, is that you stop making fun of that, that video was serious and it's kind of rude
10/24/19, 17:17 - Sara: Okay
10/24/19, 17:17 - Sara: Sorry
10/24/19, 17:17 - Sara: I really love the video
10/24/19, 17:17 - Sara: And I really feel what you said in it
10/24/19, 17:18 - Sara: Just I liked the “deal with it” phrase
10/24/19, 17:19 - Sara: I’ll comment as well that don’t treat the “sexual” content I sent you as a way to mock at me. I don’t know how is your posture towards that but idk, that is private(?)
10/24/19, 17:20 - Sara: And that incertainty is weird
10/24/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never shown it to anybody and never will, if you want, I can delete it
10/24/19, 17:21 - Sara: Up to you
10/24/19, 17:21 - Sara: But i don’t know if it is a way to laugh at me or something, at least at this in-between moment
10/24/19, 17:21 - Sara: I like sexual jokes, don’t underestimate me
10/24/19, 17:22 - Sara: It’s cute to remember
10/24/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I prefer to laugh with you rather than at you, and I didn't mean to laugh at you here
10/24/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps to early for that, sorry
10/24/19, 17:24 - Sara: That is nice, me 2
10/24/19, 17:24 - Sara: I hope the rest of jokes doesn’t insult you in other moment
10/24/19, 17:24 - Sara: I know
10/24/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really consider any of the photos embarrassing, some of them are funny, mostly just good memories
10/24/19, 17:25 - Sara: That is nice then, I feel the same
10/24/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am difficult to insult
10/24/19, 17:25 - Sara: Like being offended you mean?
10/24/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
10/24/19, 17:25 - Sara: Sure?
10/24/19, 17:26 - Sara: I don’t know, I don’t want to overpass the line bewteen joke and offense
10/24/19, 17:26 - Sara: But doesn’t limit me doing jokes 😎
10/24/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you need to worry about that
10/24/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Holocaust intensifies*
10/24/19, 17:27 - Sara: It’s a delicate moment as well

10/24/19, 18:45 - Sara: The savages WE EXTERMINATED IN AMERICA
10/24/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's your only saving grace, otherwise you should just call it quits and end Spain
10/24/19, 18:47 - Sara: Quits?
10/24/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Call it quits means to decide to abandon something
10/24/19, 18:48 - Sara: Spain ended already with Franco’s death
10/24/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice try, Paco, you're not fooling me again

10/24/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: weather is great, not melting feels very nice
10/24/19, 23:45 - Sara: That’s why I told you to go to psychologist at that moment
10/24/19, 23:46 - Sara: I’m not melting x)
10/24/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always thought that spaniards are already liquid, at least Cristina was xd
10/24/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: you know kind of like cats
10/24/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: they seem like solid creatures but in practice behave more like liquid
10/24/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: so that would protect you from melting
10/24/19, 23:48 - Sara: She’s a special case
10/24/19, 23:48 - Sara: I’m a rock xd

10/25/19, 10:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola 👋
10/25/19, 10:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not the same one
10/25/19, 10:02 - Sara: ... all polish look the same xd
10/25/19, 10:02 - Sara: How are u? Why are you awake this soon?
10/25/19, 10:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Soon? It's pretty late
10/25/19, 10:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I prefer waking up earlier, more time to do stuff
10/25/19, 10:03 - Sara: 10?
10/25/19, 10:03 - Sara: 8-9?
10/25/19, 10:04 - Sara: I understand, me 2
10/25/19, 10:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that
10/25/19, 10:04 - Sara: For writing the thesis?
10/25/19, 10:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: That and other things
10/25/19, 10:05 - Sara: Are you still doing exercises and studying?  Or something new?
10/25/19, 10:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I am
10/25/19, 10:06 - Sara: And ir’s going good?
10/25/19, 10:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Reasonably
10/25/19, 10:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you still exercising?
10/25/19, 10:10 - Sara: Not really
10/25/19, 10:10 - Sara: Lack of time and also about the surgery, i should be aware
10/25/19, 10:11 - Sara: I don’t want to force anything (i only stretch my knee from time to time) until November 23, that I have the next medical appointment
10/25/19, 10:11 - Sara: Maybe if she lets me, i’d like go dance and go back to home exercises, probably in the second semester
10/25/19, 10:12 - Sara: This one is a little bit busy x)
10/25/19, 10:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Makes sense
10/25/19, 10:12 - Sara: Well, the other one is going to be the thesis and the internship but xd
10/25/19, 10:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: What kind of dancing?
10/25/19, 10:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: No longer pole dance, right?
10/25/19, 10:12 - Sara: I’d modern one
10/25/19, 10:13 - Sara: Too expensive, although i’d like to go back if I can
10/25/19, 10:13 - Sara: In madrid it’s 60€ per month
10/25/19, 10:13 - Sara: Dance is only 30€ more or less
10/25/19, 10:13 - Sara: So that makes the difference
10/25/19, 10:13 - Sara: Also dance is a frustrated dream
i want to fulfill ^^
10/25/19, 10:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But what is it, is it solo or in pairs, any particular name? I honestly have no clue
10/25/19, 10:14 - Sara: Solo
10/25/19, 10:14 - Sara: Mmmm i don’t know.. funky, hop-hop, kpop
10/25/19, 10:14 - Sara: Depending on the dance academy
10/25/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, sounds cool 😁
10/25/19, 10:15 - Sara: Yep 😄

10/25/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't know what you're talking about
10/25/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's absolutely necessary to show my disapproval

10/26/19, 13:46 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Close enough
10/26/19, 14:32 - Sara: Best flag ever
10/26/19, 14:32 - Sara: Xd
10/26/19, 14:33 - Sara: Are you okay?
10/26/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like the paper with hearts they used for some of the letters xd
10/26/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing special
10/26/19, 14:47 - Sara: Because you love Spain
10/26/19, 14:47 - Sara: Would you like to ~do skype~ meet soon?
10/26/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if it will work well enough but I guess we can try
10/26/19, 14:52 - Sara: I just suggested it
10/26/19, 14:52 - Sara: If we are not ready we can wait
10/26/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant the connection
10/26/19, 14:53 - Sara: Oh 😂
10/26/19, 14:53 - Sara: Is it the same situation?
10/26/19, 14:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, nothing has changed so pretty much, yes
10/26/19, 14:54 - Sara: I thought it was temporal 🤔
10/26/19, 14:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's outside of the city so the signal is not particularly good in general
10/26/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe soon I will have an optic fiber internet because it seems like it might be available soon, then it should be better
10/26/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe I'll just move out before that
10/26/19, 14:57 - Sara: Really? Are you looking for flats in Lodz?
10/26/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
10/26/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: But soon I'll probably start looking for a job and I would prefer a different city, like Warsaw maybe
10/26/19, 14:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: But to move to a different city, first I'll need to finish the thesis
10/26/19, 14:59 - Sara: After finishing the thesis eight?
10/26/19, 14:59 - Sara: Righ*
10/26/19, 14:59 - Sara: Fuck xd
10/26/19, 14:59 - Sara: Understandable
10/26/19, 14:59 - Sara: Is it not expensive?
10/26/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on the district of the city
10/26/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: First I'll probably find a job, then I will know my budget
10/26/19, 15:02 - Sara: That is a better approach
10/26/19, 15:02 - Sara: Something in mind?
10/26/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the beginning of November there will be a job fair in Lodz, I'll take a look but since I still need some time to finish the thesis I haven't been looking a lot yet
10/26/19, 15:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: From the Erasmus there is one possibly interesting offer in Bristol in UK that would begin at the beginning of next year
10/26/19, 15:06 - Sara: Seems helpful!
10/26/19, 15:06 - Sara: Would you like to live in the uk?
10/26/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, the internship is for 6 months so enough time to find out, but if I don't like it's also not so long
10/26/19, 15:42 - Sara: Well, it is not bad :B
10/26/19, 15:42 - Sara: You can try
10/26/19, 16:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: When do you want to call?
10/26/19, 16:43 - Sara: I don’t know, when we can and we want
10/26/19, 16:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very helpful answer
10/26/19, 16:44 - Sara: I mean
10/26/19, 16:45 - Sara: I suggested it
10/26/19, 16:45 - Sara: If you want, we can see tomorrow
10/26/19, 16:45 - Sara: Like if you wanted. Now if you want, we can schedule something
10/26/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Without suggesting anything specific it will be like meeting with friends that you haven't seen in a long time like "yeah, we have to meet soon" and then it never happens xd
10/26/19, 16:47 - Sara: Sorry, I didn’t you if you are ready or not
10/26/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sorry, I'm not accusing or anything, just stating the facts
10/26/19, 16:47 - Sara: I insist
10/26/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
10/26/19, 16:48 - Sara: Is it okay for you?
10/26/19, 16:48 - Sara: Also it’s not about forcing or something like that x) i’m a little bit busy, but I want to reserve some hours
10/26/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: However you want
10/26/19, 16:49 - Sara: I want
10/26/19, 16:49 - Sara: I suggested it for something
10/26/19, 16:49 - Sara: I want to meet
10/26/19, 16:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I should have time tomorrow
10/26/19, 16:50 - Sara: You tell me ^^
10/26/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: You made up your mind?
10/26/19, 16:51 - Sara: About us?
10/26/19, 16:51 - Sara: Not really, I told you this is a slow process
10/26/19, 16:51 - Sara: I want to meet and see you
10/26/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, just asking, that line kind of slightly suggested
10/26/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: No rush
10/26/19, 16:53 - Sara: Okay
10/26/19, 16:53 - Sara: Thanks for understanding it ☺
10/26/19, 16:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm considering things too and I don't really know yet
10/26/19, 16:54 - Sara: It’s okay
10/26/19, 16:55 - Sara: We are in the same situation
10/26/19, 16:55 - Sara: I say the same
10/26/19, 19:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:46 - Sara: Definitely xD
10/26/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:49 - Sara: XD
10/26/19, 19:49 - Sara: Experience?
10/26/19, 19:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar to what you sent me on Instagram, same story xd
10/26/19, 19:51 - Sara: Yes xD
10/26/19, 19:51 - Sara: You’d be like that if you uploaded photos x)
10/26/19, 19:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you should be happy that I don't
10/26/19, 19:52 - Sara: Haahaha
10/26/19, 19:52 - Sara: I’m this kind of people that ridiculize herself in their social media so xD
10/26/19, 19:52 - Sara: I’m not afraid of youuuu
10/26/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, true, I always assumed that it's a defense system, like "you cannot ridicule me on the internet because I already did that myself jajaja"
10/26/19, 19:54 - Sara: Yes xd
10/26/19, 19:54 - Sara: So many people have seen my dewlap x)
10/26/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your what?
10/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: Is it called like that?
10/26/19, 19:55 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Double chin?
10/26/19, 19:56 - Sara: Yay
10/26/19, 19:56 - Sara: I wasn’t sure if that was the word
10/26/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've never heard the world dewlap in my life
10/26/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: But apparently it actually exists
10/26/19, 19:57 - Sara: Me neither x)
10/26/19, 19:57 - Sara: Maybe it’s more formal idk
10/26/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dewlap - a fold of loose skin hanging from the neck or throat of an animal, especially that present in many cattle.
10/26/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't know if it's the same
10/26/19, 19:57 - Sara: C:
10/26/19, 19:58 - Sara: Mmmm yes
10/26/19, 19:58 - Sara: Or not? Well, double chin is not loose skin
10/26/19, 19:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you're a cow whisperer so perhaps you have it to better blend in
10/26/19, 19:58 - Sara: 🐮
10/26/19, 19:59 - Sara: I’m a human cow already
10/26/19, 19:59 - Sara: I fusioned
10/26/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 20:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, new features
10/26/19, 20:03 - Sara: New superpower
10/26/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: In case someone gets thirsty in bed
10/26/19, 20:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 20:04 - Sara: True haha
10/26/19, 20:04 - Sara: I have to cry then xD
10/26/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Salty water actually dehydrates
10/26/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: So nope, I prefer milk
10/26/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: But for seasoning some dish, perhaps could be useful
10/26/19, 20:08 - Sara: But i’m soy milker pls
10/26/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Uuuuu, I see, so you're like an expensive, fancy, luxury model
10/26/19, 20:09 - Sara: Because i’m a diamond? Obv
10/26/19, 20:10 - Sara: But vegetal milks are not expensive
10/26/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: soy Sara _(confused Spanish noises)_
10/26/19, 20:11 - Sara: Confused Spanish noises?
10/26/19, 20:12 - Sara: Ññññ
10/26/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Soy soy Sara
10/26/19, 20:15 - Sara: Amazing
10/26/19, 20:15 - Sara: I can be also almond
10/26/19, 20:15 - Sara: Rice
10/26/19, 20:15 - Sara: Oat
10/26/19, 20:15 - Sara: But soy is more spanish, yes :P
10/26/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always suspected that to get soy milk you have to milk a Spanish vegan
10/26/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's why you eat sugar, to make the milk sweeter!
10/26/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now it all makes sense
10/26/19, 20:17 - Sara: ~oh shit he discovered my secret~
10/26/19, 20:18 - Sara: For me it’s quite creepy imagine someone milking a person xd
10/26/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But now I'm also slightly concerned because of the Spanish tradition of shiting in the milk 🤔
10/26/19, 20:19 - Sara: That makes it sweeter c:
10/26/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And at the same time I'm dissapointed that you never offered me your product
10/26/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You bloody capitalist
10/26/19, 20:19 - Sara: 😈
10/26/19, 20:19 - Sara: You never asked for it
10/26/19, 20:20 - Sara: I’m sooooo friendly
10/26/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Technically mothers do that sometimes
10/26/19, 20:21 - Sara: Well, yes
10/26/19, 20:21 - Sara: Themselves or directly to the creatures
10/26/19, 20:21 - Sara: But others? Xd
10/26/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Who knows, you like your boobs being sucked so maybe it could be nice
10/26/19, 20:22 - Sara: I like giving milk samples
10/26/19, 20:22 - Sara: That’s marketing
10/26/19, 20:23 - Sara: Ans you didn’t buy, so gross
10/26/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: When I was trying something must have  *broke down* because I didn't get any samples
10/26/19, 20:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I obviously didn't buy
10/26/19, 21:42 - Sara: Yes, for some months it was broken and under construction
10/26/19, 21:42 - Sara: Now is available again
10/26/19, 21:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, why do I always have to have such bad luck 😞
10/26/19, 21:56 - Sara: Next time you try
10/26/19, 21:56 - Sara: Vegan sugar soy milk
10/26/19, 21:57 - Sara: And Spanish
10/26/19, 21:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vegano azúcar soya leche (con ~mierda~ chocolate)
10/26/19, 21:59 - Sara: What a shitty translation xD
10/26/19, 21:59 - Sara: That’s me
10/26/19, 21:59 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 21:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely full of ~shit~ chocolate
10/26/19, 21:59 - Sara: Yes c:
10/26/19, 21:59 - Sara: What do you prefer
10/26/19, 22:00 - Sara: Eating chocolate with shit flavour
10/26/19, 22:00 - Sara: Or eating shit with chocolate flavour
10/26/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 22:01 - Sara: That’s an important question
10/26/19, 22:01 - Sara: Mmmmmmmmm
10/26/19, 22:01 - Sara: Hard to decide xD
10/26/19, 22:01 - Sara: Well, if people shit chocolate...
10/26/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Into milk... (or your dead relatives)
10/26/19, 22:06 - Sara: Mmmm
10/26/19, 22:06 - Sara: Chocolate party
10/26/19, 22:07 - Sara: We’ll save up a lot of money, you know
10/26/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: On the burial of the dead relatives because they will be buried under the chocolate?
10/26/19, 22:44 - Sara: I don’t want to eat my relatives :(
10/26/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But shitting on them is fine, right? xd
10/26/19, 22:45 - Sara: Yes
10/26/19, 22:45 - Sara: It’s national pride
10/26/19, 22:45 - Sara: Xd
10/26/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: So at funerals instead of burying the coffin underground everybody just shits on it?
10/26/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you have something like small pyramids instead of tombs, right?
10/26/19, 22:47 - Sara: Less expensive 👌🏻
10/26/19, 22:47 - Sara: Why pyramids? xd
10/26/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💩
10/26/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar shape
10/26/19, 22:48 - Sara: Nah
10/26/19, 22:48 - Sara: Dead people doesn’t have that shape
10/26/19, 22:48 - Sara: Unless we eat them firsf
10/26/19, 22:48 - Sara: First
10/26/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the coffin under a pile of shit...
10/26/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe even without a coffin, even cheaper
10/26/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: (maybe in the south)
10/26/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~So you should know~
10/27/19, 02:52 - Sara: Just throw the body
10/27/19, 02:52 - Sara: And we shit on it
10/27/19, 02:55 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/27/19, 13:10 - Sara: Hey, man! Would you be available 2day?
10/27/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so
10/27/19, 13:34 - Sara: Up to you ^^
10/27/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: At what time do you want?
10/27/19, 13:37 - Sara: After lunch, i’m free. Maybe I would like to do some uni stuff, but maybe around 6 i’m available... until 8-9
10/27/19, 13:37 - Sara: You?
10/27/19, 13:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems fine
10/27/19, 13:41 - Sara: 6?
10/27/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/27/19, 13:42 - Sara: Okay! 😃
10/27/19, 17:52 - Sara: Hey, i’m already available
10/27/19, 17:52 - Sara: When you can tell me ^^
10/27/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, we can try now
10/28/19, 02:22 - Sara: Btw, I was thinking that I should be more objective about all of this and not showing my feelings and thoughts about our situation. I don’t want to confuse you or making you feel weird, at least I feel that. So I apologize.
10/28/19, 09:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just try to make up your mind as soon as possible and make it clear (but again, take your time if you need it)
10/28/19, 09:15 - Sara: Okay
10/28/19, 09:15 - Sara: How are you?
10/28/19, 09:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine
10/28/19, 09:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
10/28/19, 09:27 - Sara: I’m fine also, probably tired
10/28/19, 09:27 - Sara: I woke up for revising the exam for tomorrow and puf x)
10/28/19, 09:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mucha mierda
10/28/19, 09:44 - Sara: Gracias haha
10/28/19, 09:45 - Sara: I need it
10/28/19, 15:21 - Sara: Btw, how should I treat you?
10/28/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: In what sense?
10/28/19, 15:25 - Sara: Like now, during this in-between time we are talking
10/28/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: How would you like to treat me?
10/28/19, 15:28 - Sara: As yersterday, probably. Even more open.
10/28/19, 15:28 - Sara: Like I don’t want you to feel weird, I told you
10/28/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
10/28/19, 15:29 - Sara: As before probably?
10/28/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
10/28/19, 19:58 - Sara: Caring, close approach
10/28/19, 19:58 - Sara: Like I don’t know if showing affection make things worse or better
10/28/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably depends on what happens next, unfortunately we don't know what will happen
10/28/19, 20:02 - Sara: But not showing how we really are is going to help us?
10/28/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, probably not
10/28/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking at some of those old conversations before the break up and I miss them
10/28/19, 20:05 - Sara: I want that too
10/28/19, 20:06 - Sara: But we shouldn’t be afraid of showing how we feel
10/28/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/28/19, 23:37 - Sara: 💕
10/28/19, 23:37 - Sara: That day was amazing

10/29/19, 00:12 - Sara: Why your back?
10/29/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Uncomfortable sleeping conditions
10/29/19, 00:13 - Sara: Sleeping in the floor is the best for your body
10/29/19, 00:13 - Sara: 9/10 doctors recommend it 👌🏻
10/29/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And the last one probably has to sleep on the floor
10/29/19, 00:14 - Sara: Are you a doctor?
10/29/19, 00:14 - Sara: :o
10/29/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't need medicine, I know Slovenian jesus

10/29/19, 00:31 - Sara: I think since the moment you have sent the photo, the strong feelings have been coming. And that is beautiful.
10/29/19, 00:32 - Sara: I don’t think the feelings I have for you won’t dissapear. You marked me, and that lasts.
10/29/19, 00:34 - Sara: I don’t know how this all situation is going to be and I hope everything will be okay soon. I’m afraid of losing you.
10/29/19, 00:39 - Sara: Most of the time think how things would have changed if we still in the same place. Also i thought that I miss this feeling of knowing that you have someone for sure that is by your side and always take care of you, and vice versa. You made me feel like that. Although we are a bit different, i really like learning about you.
10/29/19, 00:40 - Sara: So many feelings together right now, remembering these past events makes the flowers grow
10/29/19, 00:41 - Sara: Hope you have a very nice day tomorrow; i hope to at least fail that exam happily x)
10/29/19, 09:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>

10/29/19, 09:54 - Sara: In december there will be another film as well
10/29/19, 09:55 - Sara: Yes, and it was a massacre
10/29/19, 09:55 - Sara: Do you have the expresión 'play the lotery'?
10/29/19, 09:55 - Sara: x)

10/29/19, 10:09 - Sara: She was even joking about the dificulty of her own exams, lmao
10/29/19, 10:09 - Sara: But I have to learn from your enormous knowledge and wisdom, Mr. Kuzniak
10/29/19, 10:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Every time I hear a teacher saying something along the lines of "many of you will fail this subject" I really admire their courage to admit that they are shit at their job
10/29/19, 10:30 - Sara: Well, true
10/29/19, 10:30 - Sara: I don’t know in which moment they think “oh, i’ll be evil with my students” xd
10/29/19, 10:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the womb
10/29/19, 10:33 - Sara: Do you think these kind of teachers have the vocation of being educators?
10/29/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: At university most of the professors have to teach but they are not teachers (at least in my case)
10/29/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: So they are often not very good at it
10/29/19, 10:39 - Sara: Yes, here the same
10/29/19, 10:39 - Sara: Like you need your doctorate, so you are obligued to teach
10/29/19, 10:39 - Sara: They should learn how to be one
10/29/19, 10:39 - Sara: But c’mone
10/29/19, 10:40 - Sara: This exam was about checking if we have understood the text
10/29/19, 10:40 - Sara: And there are tricky questions ??????
10/29/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe she enjoys observing the desperation on the faces of the students
10/29/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't judge, people have different fetishes
10/29/19, 11:17 - Sara: Such a great way to be turned on 🔥
10/29/19, 11:17 - Sara: Failure and desperation yass
10/29/19, 11:19 - Sara: I have to be a good target then
10/29/19, 11:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once you got turned on by my childhood photos...
10/29/19, 11:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😂
10/29/19, 11:20 - Sara: If being horny means saying “awww” because you were too cute, i was horny af
10/29/19, 11:20 - Sara: Proud pedophile
10/29/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember it slightly differently but well... 😘

10/29/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 5 times was probably some sort of personal record for you, no?
10/29/19, 12:37 - Sara: Yes
10/29/19, 12:37 - Sara: I think my real record is 3-4
10/29/19, 12:37 - Sara: yours? x)
10/29/19, 12:40 - Sara: If I masturbate more than 5 times is because I have found something extremely amazing
10/29/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, I don't know, 2 or 3, but with rather long breaks
10/29/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember 3 times xd

10/29/19, 13:13 - Sara: But calling you prehistoric is too much :s
10/29/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, I'm a man from the previous millennium
10/29/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Basically medieval
10/29/19, 13:57 - Sara: are you a knight?

10/29/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:05 - Sara: Ha

10/29/19, 23:21 - Sara: Oh, in that sense?
10/29/19, 23:21 - Sara: It wasn’t my intention at all ><
10/29/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, you always tried to hurt me, but I played you again
10/29/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: You lost
10/29/19, 23:24 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/29/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: You tried to hurt me but you didn't know that I like it, hahaha
10/29/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: (not really)
10/29/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
10/29/19, 23:25 - Sara: But
10/29/19, 23:25 - Sara: You told me you didn’t like bdsm 🤔
10/29/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not physical
10/29/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But mental tortures are lovely
10/29/19, 23:26 - Sara: Something to say...?
10/29/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I'm kidding
10/29/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I noticed that lately we often start very stupid conversations 😂
10/29/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then they continue into more and more ridiculous things and I honestly sometimes get a bit lost at what is a joke and what is not at some point
10/29/19, 23:28 - Sara: I feel the same
10/29/19, 23:29 - Sara: With this
10/29/19, 23:29 - Sara: Or this
10/29/19, 23:29 - Sara: We can joke but maybe we have to differentiate it from real facts
10/29/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: On my side, I didn't write any of this in reference to any events
10/29/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: And none of this was serious
10/29/19, 23:30 - Sara: Me neither
10/29/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe beside the tickling 😈
10/29/19, 23:30 - Sara: But I don’t know, whastapp is not reliable
10/29/19, 23:31 - Sara: I was feeling a little bit bad, that’s why I stopped
10/29/19, 23:31 - Sara: Well, I asked
10/29/19, 23:31 - Sara: I always knew you were evil af
10/29/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, now you're safe
10/29/19, 23:32 - Sara: I wish I wasn’t 🙄
10/29/19, 23:32 - Sara: But yes, that makes me feel relief
10/29/19, 23:33 - Sara: Thanks
10/29/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: This was serious
10/29/19, 23:35 - Sara: This also
10/29/19, 23:36 - Sara: Again, thanks
10/29/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: For fixing what I broke?  well, ok
10/29/19, 23:37 - Sara: What did you break?
10/29/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: That conversation
10/29/19, 23:38 - Sara: Specific one? The one we have just had?
10/29/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: *this
10/29/19, 23:38 - Sara: I was the one interrupting it, don’t worry
10/29/19, 23:38 - Sara: It’s okay to clarify it asap
10/29/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: True, fair enough
10/29/19, 23:40 - Sara: :)
10/29/19, 23:40 - Sara: Let’s continue
10/29/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since I cannot, you can tickle yourself
10/29/19, 23:41 - Sara: You can come and do it
10/29/19, 23:41 - Sara: 😈
10/29/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, I'm starting my car already 🚗
10/29/19, 23:42 - Sara: Or by foot
10/29/19, 23:42 - Sara: Only 14 days
10/29/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: It would be nice, but I would have to go through France...
10/29/19, 23:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:43 - Sara: Best country ever
10/29/19, 23:44 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: So overrated

10/29/19, 23:44 - Sara: Tacky xd
10/29/19, 23:46 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:46 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely, the night you fell asleep in the middle of the action 😂
10/29/19, 23:47 - Sara: One of many
10/29/19, 23:48 - Sara: I *fucking* regret that
10/29/19, 23:48 - Sara: I has really serious sleeping problems xd
10/29/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Possibly the only chance to use the fucking lights for fucking and you fell asleep 😑
10/29/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: They changed colors Sara
10/29/19, 23:49 - Sara: I can buy a lava lamp
10/29/19, 23:49 - Sara: And solve this
10/29/19, 23:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:50 - Sara: I disappointed my race

10/29/19, 23:51 - Sara: Probably yes
10/29/19, 23:51 - Sara: Or at least I wish
10/29/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess it could be a late birthday present
10/29/19, 23:52 - Sara: Hahaha
10/29/19, 23:53 - Sara: This was the best present in my birthday
10/29/19, 23:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, still, could be useful
10/29/19, 23:56 - Sara: For me not to sleep? Xd
10/29/19, 23:58 - Sara: you wouldn’t let me
10/29/19, 23:58 - Sara: That’s for sure
10/29/19, 23:59 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/29/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would dare you to wear it to the lecture
10/30/19, 00:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: You talk a lot but I'm sure that you would never actually do it, coward
10/30/19, 00:03 - Sara: Well
10/30/19, 00:03 - Sara: I have never seen myself only having vaginal stimulation
10/30/19, 00:03 - Sara: So i’m curious xD
10/30/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where did you see it?
10/30/19, 00:06 - Sara: Where?
10/30/19, 00:06 - Sara: Physical erotic shop
10/30/19, 00:07 - Sara: I think the one in Madrid
10/30/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: So not much is stopping you from getting it
10/30/19, 00:07 - Sara: Is that a proposal? 🤔
10/30/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fifty-fifty?
10/30/19, 00:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 00:08 - Sara: Are you sure?
10/30/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not?
10/30/19, 00:09 - Sara: Because well... our situation is in-between right now
10/30/19, 00:09 - Sara: I mean, for me can be fine
10/30/19, 00:10 - Sara: Thanks Kamil, now i’m horny xd
10/30/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it is a step forward, maybe not, at that price, either way I'm not going to regret it
10/30/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pfff, mujeres
10/30/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So easy

10/30/19, 00:20 - Sara: Nah, not masturbating
10/30/19, 00:21 - Sara: (Yet, we don’t know) probably sleepyness overcomes excitenent
10/30/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant trying to sleep, it's a moon Sara, please, contain yourself

10/30/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Watch the show and you will know 😁
10/30/19, 18:20 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

10/30/19, 22:41 - Sara: Btw, do you want to meet some of these days?
10/30/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, why not
10/30/19, 22:42 - Sara: Nice! Which days can you?
10/30/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not tomorrow, other than that, probably any day
10/30/19, 22:43 - Sara: Okaaay, i’ll have it in mind
10/30/19, 22:43 - Sara: Meeting your friend?
10/30/19, 22:43 - Sara: ^^
10/30/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: He's throwing a party
10/30/19, 22:43 - Sara: Oh cool! Have fun 👻
10/30/19, 22:43 - Sara: How was your day?
10/30/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing particularly interesting today, I studied some stuff and finished watching la casa de papel
10/30/19, 22:44 - Sara: Was it good?
10/30/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
10/30/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you watch it?
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: Nop
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: Should I?
10/30/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: Cool
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: I have heard a lot about it
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: Good and bad commenta
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: Comments
10/30/19, 22:45 - Sara: I’ll check if I can
10/30/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how was your day?
10/30/19, 22:46 - Sara: It was good
10/30/19, 22:46 - Sara: I went to class and did some uni stuff
10/30/19, 22:46 - Sara: Then I went to a book presentation of a feminist writer I love a lot, and it was great 💕
10/30/19, 22:47 - Sara: Now i’ll do more uni stuff
10/30/19, 22:47 - Sara: But i’m feeling weird, tbh
10/30/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
10/30/19, 22:48 - Sara: You may freak out a bit, i want to show you that I also have feelings x)
10/30/19, 22:48 - Sara: Guada has told me he’s going to travel with his partner, and some tiny emotions are there wandering in my head
10/30/19, 22:49 - Sara: I can also have insecurities x)
10/30/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand
10/30/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is quite difficult to see our loved ones (current or past) with someone else
10/30/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps it's a bit of jealousy
10/30/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe just missing the happier times
10/30/19, 22:50 - Sara: It is more about being afraid of losing that person, i think
10/30/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing to be ashamed of
10/30/19, 22:51 - Sara: But yes, i completely agree
10/30/19, 22:51 - Sara: So i don’t know, i’m not that heartless x)
10/30/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps you can understand me too
10/30/19, 22:52 - Sara: I understand you and I have always had
10/30/19, 22:52 - Sara: I try to make understand the others that i won’t go anywhere
10/30/19, 22:52 - Sara: But insecurities > everything, probably
10/30/19, 22:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm also thinking about going somewhere, I'm getting tired off sitting in one place
10/30/19, 22:53 - Sara: In Poland...
10/30/19, 22:54 - Sara: 🤔
10/30/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I still have no clue what to do on new year's eve
10/30/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: When do you have that holiday?
10/30/19, 22:55 - Sara: Beginning of december
10/30/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: For November probably in Poland, in December perhaps I could go somewhere
10/30/19, 22:55 - Sara: Me neither, probably studying a bit xdd #crying
10/30/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: #Venice
10/30/19, 22:58 - Sara: 6-9th
10/30/19, 22:58 - Sara: Don’t say it twice...
10/30/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Venice venice
10/30/19, 22:58 - Sara: **buying tickets**
10/30/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will actually ask Andrea tomorrow if he was serious about that
10/30/19, 23:01 - Sara: Hahahaha
10/30/19, 23:01 - Sara: That is fine
10/30/19, 23:01 - Sara: How is normally your new years’ eve?
10/30/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some party with friends, but now it's somewhat difficult
10/30/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last year I was in Ghent
10/30/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would actually really like to go somewhere
10/30/19, 23:02 - Sara: Some place in concrete?
10/30/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, Venice xd
10/30/19, 23:03 - Sara: That could be very nice
10/30/19, 23:04 - Sara: Idk if for me it would be suitable but i’ll see
10/30/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or just Spain, although it does depend on our situation
10/30/19, 23:05 - Sara: New years eve?
10/30/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/30/19, 23:06 - Sara: I could give you a place to sleep, yes
10/30/19, 23:06 - Sara: Idk how my parents would react but for me it’s nice
10/30/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Toledo? Why not Madrid?
10/30/19, 23:07 - Sara: Also
10/30/19, 23:07 - Sara: It could be like that
10/30/19, 23:07 - Sara: But alone?
10/30/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I haven't thought about it at all yet
10/30/19, 23:08 - Sara: More erasmus people in Madrid yayy haha
10/30/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where would you be?
10/30/19, 23:08 - Sara: What exactly?
10/30/19, 23:09 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, Idk, I don't have any plan, just suggested something because you asked
10/30/19, 23:11 - Sara: Yes yes
10/30/19, 23:11 - Sara: Travelling is fine
10/30/19, 23:11 - Sara: And that’s why i suggested my holiday break
10/30/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that case it's time to start planning it now or at least very soon
10/30/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But, not going to lie, it also depends on our situation
10/30/19, 23:13 - Sara: True
10/30/19, 23:13 - Sara: How is it right now?
10/30/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Honestly, I don't know
10/30/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment, I would be willing to travel, I guess
10/30/19, 23:14 - Sara: What does it mean?
10/30/19, 23:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: That it's rather unclear for me right now, but I have some hope
10/30/19, 23:15 - Sara: That is nice
10/30/19, 23:16 - Sara: i’m fine with this
10/30/19, 23:16 - Sara: Or being like this
10/30/19, 23:16 - Sara: Idk, i’ll let things grow
10/30/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: How long? I'll be honest that if it last months it's not exactly my dream scenario
10/30/19, 23:18 - Sara: What is your dream scenario exactly?
10/30/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, dream scenario, I just don't want this in-between phase to last very long
10/30/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You know that I rather dislike uncertainty
10/30/19, 23:19 - Sara: I understand
10/30/19, 23:20 - Sara: Like I dislike fear
10/30/19, 23:20 - Sara: Like this is something i’m comfortable with
10/30/19, 23:20 - Sara: But also idk what would happen, and that is alarming
10/30/19, 23:21 - Sara: It is weird
10/30/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: At some point decisions will have to be made
10/30/19, 23:21 - Sara: Yes...
10/30/19, 23:22 - Sara: But i don’t deal this black/white thing
10/30/19, 23:22 - Sara: But again
10/30/19, 23:23 - Sara: I want to think and i’ll use this time to think
10/30/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think I gave you all (or at least most of the information) about my point of view and how I feel
10/30/19, 23:24 - Sara: I know
10/30/19, 23:24 - Sara: And that is hard
10/30/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: If your answer is no, it's fine, just don't drag this out for months, please
10/30/19, 23:25 - Sara: I know I know
10/30/19, 23:25 - Sara: I want to see how this goes
10/30/19, 23:26 - Sara: Also I like knowing about you, I love you and I want to see if everything is possible
10/30/19, 23:27 - Sara: If I make a decision I want to be 200%
10/30/19, 23:27 - Sara: sure
10/30/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I just hope that you know you cannot delay this forever
10/30/19, 23:28 - Sara: It is only my “delay”?
10/30/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I'm considering things, perhaps meeting in person would able to make things clearer
10/30/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe not, who knows
10/30/19, 23:29 - Sara: I agree
10/30/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Waiting and being like this takes it's toll, it is a bit stressful for me
10/30/19, 23:30 - Sara: Are you not comfortable with me?
10/30/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not very comfortable with the current situation, I understand and agree that it takes some time and steps to reach the conclusion but it's a bit painful anyway
10/30/19, 23:32 - Sara: Why painful? :(
10/30/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not knowing what will happen, not knowing what to do, how to behave, being constantly reminded of the happier times
10/30/19, 23:33 - Sara: Do you want to change something?
10/30/19, 23:34 - Sara: I’m happy knowing about you, talking, seeing each other, making plans and jokes
10/30/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I guess I just need to be patient
10/30/19, 23:34 - Sara: But i don’t like you being sad 😔
10/30/19, 23:35 - Sara: This is so complex...
10/30/19, 23:36 - Sara: I’m afraid and so happy at the same time with all of this...
10/30/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I might have a solution...

10/30/19, 23:37 - Sara: I’m a tomato 🍅
10/30/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: We have a very nice song about love and whiskey in Poland
10/30/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfwGiieFkKo
10/30/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe you can find a translation somewhere
10/30/19, 23:38 - Sara: I’ll check
10/30/19, 23:38 - Sara: Do you have any song about how uncertainty sucks?
10/30/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure I could find something
10/30/19, 23:40 - Sara: Please
10/30/19, 23:40 - Sara: And how love is amazing and sucks at the same time?
10/30/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, the poem I wrote on your t-shirt is titled uncertainty
10/30/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: although it is a bit different kind, I think
10/30/19, 23:40 - Sara: I have it next to me ♥
10/30/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 23:41 - Sara: Anything in mind?
10/30/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm thinking
10/30/19, 23:42 - Sara: In general I mean
10/30/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, not polish but I like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujNeHIo7oTEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujNeHIo7oTE
10/30/19, 23:43 - Sara: Yes, it’s a good song
10/30/19, 23:44 - Sara: I feel like crying, cuddling and having an ice-cream
10/30/19, 23:44 - Sara: My period is coming ☺
10/30/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, at least you're not pregnant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M&t=1s
10/30/19, 23:45 - Sara: Hahahaha
10/30/19, 23:45 - Sara: I hope not
10/30/19, 23:45 - Sara: But talking seriously, now I feel lost
10/30/19, 23:46 - Sara: Neither crucifies
10/30/19, 23:46 - Sara: Crucified
10/30/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Rch6WvPJE
10/30/19, 23:46 - Sara: You and your way of communicating with songs
10/30/19, 23:47 - Sara: Haha
10/30/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 23:48 - Sara: Always
10/30/19, 23:48 - Sara: Can you send a hug?
10/30/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
10/30/19, 23:49 - Sara: :,)
10/30/19, 23:49 - Sara: Thanks 🙏🏻
10/30/19, 23:49 - Sara: Mental breakdown hahahhaa yay, so characteristic
10/30/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: you want to call now?
10/30/19, 23:50 - Sara: I can
10/30/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you want, go ahead
10/30/19, 23:52 - Sara: I don’t want to disturb you
10/30/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's fine, don't worry
10/30/19, 23:53 - Sara: sure?
10/30/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure, sure
10/30/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would get on my bike, but that doesn't work so well anymore 😓
10/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: hahaha
10/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: long way tho
10/31/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn8XXPl1vjU
10/31/19, 02:33 - Sara: Don’t misanderstand, I really want to try
10/31/19, 02:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: On the topic of why I don't want to be friends if this doesn't work out and why I'm not particularly happy with the current situation:
10/31/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Loving someone and not being able to be with them is painful, much more than I ever imagined
10/31/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been feeling that ever since the breakup
10/31/19, 02:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And briefly in Ghent too
10/31/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a terrible feeling and I feel it now too
10/31/19, 02:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps I could be just your friend, but only if I lost all my love for you
10/31/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if that's possible
10/31/19, 02:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't really want that
10/31/19, 02:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps it is selfish, but I don't want to suffer
10/31/19, 10:01 - Sara: Being to be with someone else physically talking or as a couple?
10/31/19, 10:02 - Sara: But yes, I agree. I am really suffering because I want to have you in my life but I don’t know how is my situation with (close) relationship, Ricardo and you
10/31/19, 10:04 - Sara: And I love you and I have special feelings for you, and I want to know you more, travel with you and everything
10/31/19, 10:05 - Sara: Why losing it? Again, don’t deny your feelings, let’s tranform it
10/31/19, 10:09 - Sara: But again, that’s my opinion and you don’t share it
10/31/19, 10:11 - Sara: But from my experience, when I accepted that I can control my emptions and how to treat people I fet better
10/31/19, 10:12 - Sara: Selfish... not really, maybe coward. But i’m also coward because i don’t face what i have and i don’t want to suffer and make suffer
10/31/19, 10:13 - Sara: But maybe you have to consider me a lit, I try to understand you in 100%
10/31/19, 10:14 - Sara: Everything is complex
10/31/19, 10:14 - Sara: Or maybe we don’t see the easy way
10/31/19, 10:14 - Sara: Maybe we try to make something impossible
10/31/19, 10:16 - Sara: I hope we can find soon a balance, something both we are happy with
10/31/19, 10:17 - Sara: Like I don’t understand how is possible that someone makes you happy but the way you are with them makes you anxious.
10/31/19, 10:17 - Sara: For me it’s contradictory
10/31/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is, I never said that I'm happy now
10/31/19, 10:37 - Sara: I know, but when we are talking I see you...I see you comfortable
10/31/19, 10:37 - Sara: That's what I mean
10/31/19, 10:37 - Sara: I don't like neither this situation of uncertainty, but I really enjoy seeing you and talking to you
10/31/19, 10:37 - Sara: Btw, thanks for the call yesterday
10/31/19, 10:40 - Sara: In that way, I see contradictions
10/31/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Talking with you affects me not only at the moment of the talking but also afterwards, when we are talking, I don't focus on what makes me sad, so I at least try to enjoy it
10/31/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's like trying to forget about your problems by getting busy with something else
10/31/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: To get your mind away from the problems
10/31/19, 10:43 - Sara: So you use me to forget your problems?
10/31/19, 10:43 - Sara: Affecting you badly or in a good way?
10/31/19, 10:44 - Sara: I don't know, I talk to you because I like talking to you
10/31/19, 10:44 - Sara: And to salve everything
10/31/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at all what I meant
10/31/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that when I talk to you I do my best to not think about the problems so we can talk normally
10/31/19, 10:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depending on the day
10/31/19, 10:46 - Sara: You can be honest with me
10/31/19, 10:46 - Sara: I cried yesterday
10/31/19, 10:47 - Sara: I'm here for the good and the bad things
10/31/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yesterday, you affected me rather negatively, probably for the next few days, but don't worry, at some point it's necessary
10/31/19, 10:48 - Sara: Why? I want to know
10/31/19, 10:48 - Sara: I only told my confusion
10/31/19, 10:49 - Sara: We are going though the same
10/31/19, 10:49 - Sara: It wasn't my intention
10/31/19, 10:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's feeding into my own doubts about all of this
10/31/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the beginning I thought I had this figured out and just needed your choice but I'm not so sure anymore
10/31/19, 10:50 - Sara: Sorry
10/31/19, 10:50 - Sara: Tell me why
10/31/19, 10:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: With all the things you said, I just don't know anymore if I even still want to be together, if I can ever feel happy with you
10/31/19, 10:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: And the fact that I even have these thoughts upsets me a lot
10/31/19, 10:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Long term, not just for a few minutes or hours
10/31/19, 10:53 - Sara: I understand
10/31/19, 10:54 - Sara: I rather prefer thinking about the present and the near future
10/31/19, 10:54 - Sara: But yes, this situation is complex
10/31/19, 10:55 - Sara: I don't know... what should we do?
10/31/19, 10:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Make up your own mind
10/31/19, 10:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll try to do the same
10/31/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me the question was and still is if it's even possible to un-break the heart
10/31/19, 11:03 - Sara: Need space? Time?
10/31/19, 11:03 - Sara: How is that possible?
10/31/19, 11:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Time, probably, space, not necessarily
10/31/19, 11:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's the question, maybe it's not
10/31/19, 11:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I felt broken hearted after you left and that feeling never completely left, just over time it got easier to not think about it
10/31/19, 11:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if I still want it or maybe I'm just clinging to old memories
10/31/19, 11:24 - Sara: I don't if the space is necessary as well
10/31/19, 11:24 - Sara: But I don't know
10/31/19, 11:24 - Sara: Feelings from me will be the same
10/31/19, 11:24 - Sara: I understand
10/31/19, 11:25 - Sara: Maybe it is about consideran a relationship when your heart is repaired?
10/31/19, 11:25 - Sara: And it should be repaired by you, not me
10/31/19, 11:25 - Sara: I don't you if you get my idea
10/31/19, 11:25 - Sara: I'm here to help, of course
10/31/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think for that some sort of replacement parts are necessary
10/31/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is why even decided to attempt to get back together
10/31/19, 11:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hoping that it just heals on its own, Idk, seems unlikely to me
10/31/19, 11:29 - Sara: I understand that feel
10/31/19, 11:29 - Sara: But I repaired my heart from an alost 7 years relationship
10/31/19, 11:29 - Sara: So it's possible
10/31/19, 11:30 - Sara: What I mean is
10/31/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Was it really on your own?
10/31/19, 11:30 - Sara: You shouldn't depend on people to be happy
10/31/19, 11:30 - Sara: In what sense?
10/31/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Didn't you have plenty of help, love, friendship etc? For some time there was also me, I guess
10/31/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's what I mean with replacement parts
10/31/19, 11:31 - Sara: Well, that is true
10/31/19, 11:31 - Sara: Asking for help is necessary
10/31/19, 11:32 - Sara: I learnt how I can be independent, I guess
10/31/19, 11:32 - Sara: But being supported by people
10/31/19, 11:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me healing the heart to be again with the person that broke it is different than healing the heart and moving on
10/31/19, 11:33 - Sara: Tell me
10/31/19, 11:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you just move on, you meet a new person and the old memories don't drag you down, a new page
10/31/19, 11:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But to return, Idk, there are many pages already written, and recent ones, not really pleasant
10/31/19, 11:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you kept saying about starting a new thing, but I don't think it's possible, not entirely
10/31/19, 11:36 - Sara: Why not?
10/31/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it's supposed to be a new opening than why did we talk recently about old photos and memories?
10/31/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's always going to be based on that, I think
10/31/19, 11:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Without the past we wouldn't be talking right now
10/31/19, 11:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: All of this right now is based on Ghent, memories I have after that wouldn't push me to try again
10/31/19, 11:42 - Sara: Yes, I don't deny our origin
10/31/19, 11:42 - Sara: But I'm not the same Sara
10/31/19, 11:42 - Sara: And I won't behave as before
10/31/19, 11:42 - Sara: so are you
10/31/19, 11:43 - Sara: And I will estables my relationships according to my present maturity
10/31/19, 11:43 - Sara: establish*
10/31/19, 11:44 - Sara: I'm talking with the Kamil I know now
10/31/19, 11:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: if just friendship was an option would you even consider being a couple again?
10/31/19, 11:50 - Sara: What do you mean?
10/31/19, 11:50 - Sara: I think I understand it
10/31/19, 11:50 - Sara: but be clearer
10/31/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm afraid that you are considering the relationship only because the other option is nothing
10/31/19, 11:51 - Sara: It is both
10/31/19, 11:51 - Sara: I still love you and I want a link with you, couple or not
10/31/19, 11:52 - Sara: It's not that weird that I want again a relationship
10/31/19, 11:52 - Sara: and at the same time keeping people I care near me
10/31/19, 11:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: so would you or would you just tell me to be friends?
10/31/19, 11:53 - Sara: What?
10/31/19, 11:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: would you want a relationship or just friendship?
10/31/19, 11:54 - Sara: Right now? in general?
10/31/19, 11:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm trying to find out how this affects your decision making
10/31/19, 11:56 - Sara: It affects a lot
10/31/19, 11:56 - Sara: But it's not like
10/31/19, 11:57 - Sara: oh, i don't feel like having a relationship
10/31/19, 11:57 - Sara: but it's a feeling of ''i don't know if I can have a relationship like he says'' or ''idk if i will change a por for that'' ''If we are going to be happy ''if i'll break his heart''
10/31/19, 11:59 - Sara: I'm afraid of losing myself
10/31/19, 11:59 - Sara: Denying other feelings
10/31/19, 12:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was asking mainly because of that
10/31/19, 12:00 - Sara: I don't know what is sacrifica or what is a change in live
10/31/19, 12:01 - Sara: I'm not forcing you to anything
10/31/19, 12:01 - Sara: I'm just trying to find a solution
10/31/19, 12:02 - Sara: You are only giving me all our nothing
10/31/19, 12:02 - Sara: and that makes me feel that you need me, and you don't want me in your life
10/31/19, 12:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: if the final decision would be different because of this, than it's not something that I want
10/31/19, 12:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: you're not, but perhaps I am forcing you
10/31/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I tried to make it clear how does the friendship make me feel
10/31/19, 12:05 - Sara: And that is normal?
10/31/19, 12:05 - Sara: Bad because you love me and you want a relationship, right?
10/31/19, 12:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, and I'm not happy about it, it wasn't really my intention, it just happened based on other factors, sorry
10/31/19, 12:06 - Sara: What factors?
10/31/19, 12:07 - Sara: Imagine my situation
10/31/19, 12:07 - Sara: You want to love someone, no matter how. What is important is keep contact, showing affection..
10/31/19, 12:07 - Sara: But the other one is offering two very contrastive options that overwhelm you
10/31/19, 12:07 - Sara: at least at this moment
10/31/19, 12:09 - Sara: And you try other solutions
10/31/19, 12:09 - Sara: to find comfortability without sacrificios ourselves and being happy
10/31/19, 12:10 - Sara: What is important? having a relationship or being okay both individual and collectively?
10/31/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: you're assuming that what would make you feel okay would also make me feel okay
10/31/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: we're different and I'm not so sure if we can find a middle ground
10/31/19, 12:11 - Sara: I'm sure we can
10/31/19, 12:11 - Sara: We have the same base
10/31/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Imagine my situation, I want to be with someone, it makes me happy, but if I stay with you on your terms I can never have that. You want to love but not be together, so effectively it would always be in the way of me finding someone else, I don't think anybody would be happy with a relationship in which their partner is still in love with someone else
10/31/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would just stay stuck in a strange, hard to define position
10/31/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not willing to do that, but I also do not expect anything from you, I understand that I put you in a difficult position and I do not expect you to sacrifice anything
10/31/19, 12:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: and as you said nobody needs anybody, you don't need me, so maybe that makes the decision easier
10/31/19, 12:45 - Sara: Together in your terms means, as far as i concerned, doubts about my personality and fears
10/31/19, 12:45 - Sara: Being in love is a big term I have only with you because we have been more intimate
10/31/19, 12:46 - Sara: What I can feel for others is different, but they’re still feelings
10/31/19, 12:46 - Sara: Not only related to love
10/31/19, 12:47 - Sara: I don’t know if a relationship means renounce to treating others differently (quitinf sex, kisses...h
10/31/19, 12:47 - Sara: It’s no a strange position
10/31/19, 12:47 - Sara: I wish it was easy xd
10/31/19, 12:50 - Sara: What is hard for you in this strange situation?
10/31/19, 12:50 - Sara: Me having “things” with others? Not treating you “special”?
10/31/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to discuss my view on relationship again, I already told you everything and it feels pointless to repeat myself. You have a different view and I respect that and I'm not trying to change it, and I have mine. I never said and I will never say that mine or yours point of view is right or wrong, better or worse because it's not. As far as I'm concerned they are just different opinions, and there is no unversally correct answer, every person has their own correct answer
10/31/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want you to sacrifice yours, but I'm also not going to sacrifice mine
10/31/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I no longer want to keep things or people at all cost, I already told you, and you should do the same
10/31/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: So overall, I understand your point but I don't want it, and I think you understand mine and you also don't want it
10/31/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I guess that makes everything pretty clear
10/31/19, 13:24 - Sara: So tell me
10/31/19, 13:25 - Sara: Again, if I take a decision is in a long term period
10/31/19, 13:25 - Sara: And you pushing me to decide now hurts
10/31/19, 13:26 - Sara: If you have it clear, tell me
10/31/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, since our current stances are not compatible and neither of us should have to change it, I don't really see many possibilities
10/31/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you?
10/31/19, 13:29 - Sara: Up to you
10/31/19, 13:29 - Sara: I don’t want to decide at the moment
10/31/19, 13:29 - Sara: But I need my time and space
10/31/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I can give you that
10/31/19, 13:30 - Sara: Okay
10/31/19, 13:32 - Sara: I think both need to heal
10/31/19, 13:32 - Sara: And to make up our minds
10/31/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was asking questions to make up my own mind, not to push you towards a decision
10/31/19, 13:43 - Sara: This one?
10/31/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
10/31/19, 14:30 - Sara: Okay
10/31/19, 14:30 - Sara: You think I may joke
10/31/19, 14:30 - Sara: But I want to wait at least until my period finishes xd
10/31/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand and I wouldn't consider it a joke
10/31/19, 19:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/4/19, 17:42 - Sara: Kamil, can you talk?
11/4/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess so
11/4/19, 20:37 - Sara: Well, i’d need more time
11/4/19, 20:37 - Sara: I’ll go out now
11/4/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok
11/4/19, 20:38 - Sara: Are you okay?
11/4/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
11/4/19, 20:45 - Sara: That is okay
11/5/19, 00:02 - Sara: Well, I don’t care if talking via whastapp or via messenger but I want to talk asap with you
11/5/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like now?
11/5/19, 00:08 - Sara: Up to you
11/5/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine by me
11/5/19, 00:09 - Sara: How?
11/5/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: All the same
11/5/19, 00:10 - Sara: I suppose it is better by messenger
11/6/19, 10:01 - Sara: Okay, I swear that this is my last message. But I need to know it to think more in depth. What are the specific conditions that you’ll put to the “dating” situation you mentioned? Like literal, I’d like to know what you have in mind.
11/6/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it probably depends how you define dating, for me if I'm dating someone, than the end goal would be a relationship. If it turns out that it's not working so well, than it's either just a goodbye or maybe, if I still liked the person, just not that much, maybe stay as friends. I also told you that I think it's unfair to date a few people at the same time. If I went on a date with someone and they would tell me that they are also dating someone else at the same time, I think there would be no second date. I don't know what kind of conditions to be honest I would put, at this point I don't fully trust you and you don't fully trust me and you don't know what to expect from me. I was considering visiting you at the beginning of December, I think it's rather difficult to prove anything over the phone, words are just words, actions are more convincing. Maybe it could change something, or maybe I would just return home more heartbroken, that's something I'm afraid of. I guess in such case I would ask you for some patience, at least until we meet in person, I don't know if that would be difficult or not, you said that you focus on studying anyway. So, yeah, that's kind of what was going through my mind throughout the last week, I didn't think everything through in much detail.
11/6/19, 13:40 - Sara: You decide if you want to come (or doing any travel) or to take more space. I can be patient.
11/6/19, 13:41 - Sara: From one hand, if everything can be solved soon could be nice. But on the other hand, also time and space can make us see everything from a different perspective.
11/6/19, 13:42 - Sara: Nobody knows anything, I'm sure of that. We are still confused, that is normal
11/6/19, 13:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I meant patience like give us a chance and wait with dating someone else, at least for a bit, but it doesn't matter
11/6/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why did you ask?
11/6/19, 14:04 - Sara: For a specific reason?
11/6/19, 14:05 - Sara: I still consider the decision
11/6/19, 14:25 - Sara: But I don’t still get the “no dating someone else” if it is a “trying” process
11/6/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I will tell you why I would never do that, I don't want to have to make a decision if it happens that I like both of my dates. Also if somebody would tell me that they are dating someone else at the same time, that tells me that they are not particularly interested, if I decide to go on a date it's for some reason, not just random choice
11/6/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it's basic respect, if I'm "trying" if something can work or not I can at least give that person my full attention
11/6/19, 14:32 - Sara: Well, I understand the first thing ~hahahaha me~
11/6/19, 14:33 - Sara: But at the same time I think if I’m dating someone is because I can be interested in both, but it is my experience
11/6/19, 14:33 - Sara: Would you impose it?
11/6/19, 14:35 - Sara: Again, i’m considering everything. I’m asking
11/6/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: How exactly? If someone isn't even willing to give me a chance and are already looking for something else how can I ever feel safe and comfortable with that person? It's not like dating takes years, if something doesn't click you probably can know that fairly quickly and end it in some way, if you're not even willing to sacrifice that little bit of time for someone than we have nothing to talk about
11/6/19, 14:41 - Sara: Sacrifice xd
11/6/19, 14:41 - Sara: It has a negative connotation
11/6/19, 14:41 - Sara: And nobody should be forced to do that
11/6/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, perhaps not the best word
11/6/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not forcing anybody, someone either wants to spend their time on "trying" with me or not
11/6/19, 14:43 - Sara: But you are showing that you feel insecure if that person “doesn’t focus on you”
11/6/19, 14:44 - Sara: I can try with you, I want, but you cannot limit in other aspects
11/6/19, 14:44 - Sara: If that person is really comfortable, they will know that they can do “a commitment”
11/6/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you're not really willing to give it a chance, you want to keep looking for better opportunities
11/6/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that is supposed to build a trusting atmosphere?
11/6/19, 14:46 - Sara: Not at all
11/6/19, 14:46 - Sara: But you cannot tell people what to do
11/6/19, 14:47 - Sara: I don’t know, it’s like Kamil’s rules
11/6/19, 14:47 - Sara: And again, I want to try
11/6/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I gave you my opinion, I feel that it's disrespectful if you don't even want to give someone a week, maybe a month at most to try
11/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: Maybe I need my time but idk
11/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: I want to try
11/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: But again
11/6/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not like it's a heavy commitment for the rest of your life
11/6/19, 14:48 - Sara: You don’t take me in consideration
11/6/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And do you take me?
11/6/19, 14:49 - Sara: Yes, probably more than you do
11/6/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: All I asked for was what? A month of your time?
11/6/19, 14:50 - Sara: A month of not trying anything with someone else?
11/6/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would say that a month to see if there can still be something between us
11/6/19, 14:51 - Sara: Kamil, don’t you see here there is only conditions made by you?
11/6/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you always focus on the limitations
11/6/19, 14:52 - Sara: Why shouldn’t I?
11/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: Probably is something to take in consideration about you or about the love life I want to have
11/6/19, 14:53 - Sara: Obv
11/6/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once again, I gave you my opinion, you don't have to agree with it
11/6/19, 14:54 - Sara: But a couple, if you want that, is not like that
11/6/19, 14:54 - Sara: It’s not monolethic i think
11/6/19, 14:55 - Sara: And you are not even asking for my view
11/6/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wasn't asking to be a couple, I was asking for some time to evaluate if anything is even possible
11/6/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought I got your view from your answers, but ok, tell me
11/6/19, 14:56 - Sara: And for me it’s fine, but i don’t understand I have to stop this part of my life for me to know if I can be in a relationship with you
11/6/19, 14:56 - Sara: Or for you to trust me
11/6/19, 14:57 - Sara: Tell me
11/6/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: From all the things you say I keep getting a strong vibe of open relationships, of which I already gave my opinion and which I don't want in my life
11/6/19, 14:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I want to have everything clear so that in the end nobody is forced into anything
11/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: For me it is like you have to proof you are s good reason for me to have a close relationship
11/6/19, 14:59 - Sara: Most of my trust is gone, i’m hurt
11/6/19, 15:00 - Sara: With the vibes I have about you I don’t feel secure to have this cmmitment you commented
11/6/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know
11/6/19, 15:00 - Sara: But I think I need time to see it
11/6/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is why I wanted to have at least some time to try rebuilding it
11/6/19, 15:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: And visit you
11/6/19, 15:00 - Sara: And I want to see that I really want to have a (close) relationship with you even if I have “”other options”””
11/6/19, 15:00 - Sara: Me 2
11/6/19, 15:00 - Sara: I’d love it
11/6/19, 15:01 - Sara: I hope you undertand me
11/6/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: And here comes the question of how much do you really take me into consideration, you say you don't trust me, but that is mutual right now
11/6/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: And for that reason words don't have much value right now
11/6/19, 15:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was considering what I can do and well, for now I thought about visiting you in Spain, I don't expect it to be enough but it would be more meaningful than anything I can say
11/6/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this works both ways
11/6/19, 15:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I could sing, maybe I would try to record a song xd
11/6/19, 18:39 - Sara: For me it can be fine, but what do you want to see?
11/6/19, 18:39 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/6/19, 18:39 - Sara: I encourage you ❤
11/6/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that my words are not enough and that's why I'm thinking about actions, but your words are not enough either
11/6/19, 19:11 - Sara: When words are enough?
11/6/19, 19:11 - Sara: Gosh, I don’t know what to do with anything
11/6/19, 19:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: When there is trust
11/6/19, 19:12 - Sara: Trust needs to be built I think
11/6/19, 19:12 - Sara: Well, in my case it is more about fear and insecurities
11/6/19, 19:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, but the question remains how, when words are not enough?
11/6/19, 19:14 - Sara: Messages can hide a lot of feelings and thoughts
11/6/19, 19:14 - Sara: Also hides reactions
11/6/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which is why I was considering visiting
11/6/19, 19:15 - Sara: To see how is our reaction?
11/6/19, 19:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think either of us can convince the other of anything by text
11/6/19, 19:16 - Sara: I agree
11/6/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the same time I'm afraid that I would just return home more heartbroken than before, like after Italy
11/6/19, 19:18 - Sara: And me more confused
11/6/19, 19:18 - Sara: I understand, this is tough
11/6/19, 19:18 - Sara: What is good for us?
11/6/19, 19:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know
11/6/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you at least give us a month and after meeting somewhere in person we would decide if it's worth it to continue or not?
11/6/19, 19:20 - Sara: I was thinking as well about taking distance from you and Ricardo, this is driving me insane
11/6/19, 19:21 - Sara: Like i don’t know what to do with both of you
11/6/19, 19:21 - Sara: I want to meet you and see what happens but if I need to take a decision I prefer being away from this situation, at least for two weeks or something
11/6/19, 19:22 - Sara: However, I accept your visit or the idea to travel in december
11/6/19, 19:22 - Sara: 😖
11/6/19, 19:23 - Sara: Or doing this as well
11/6/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Up to you, I was asking you to give us a month and not date other people at least for that short time mainly because of current lack of trust and fear
11/6/19, 19:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I'm having all sorts of doubts about all of this
11/6/19, 19:28 - Sara: I don’t know, I have to realise of what I want. Like.. I feel i have to go outside the house to reflect on what is going on inside
11/6/19, 19:28 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/6/19, 19:28 - Sara: But I want this at the same time
11/6/19, 19:28 - Sara: Ugh
11/6/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the end I don't feel happy without you, and every time I decide that Ishould just give it all up because it will just hurt me more, the next day I want to run back to you
11/6/19, 19:29 - Sara: Maybe I have been recently stressed with all of this and I need air
11/6/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't know anymore
11/6/19, 19:30 - Sara: I don’t want to lose you neither
11/6/19, 19:30 - Sara: I feel the same
11/6/19, 19:30 - Sara: Like one day I have it clear this is not a good situation for me, but the other I’d like to start again with you
11/6/19, 19:30 - Sara: We are on the same page
11/6/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can either try something for this one month or get some space, so up to you what you prefer
11/6/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if we will meet somehow we should plan it very soon
11/6/19, 19:34 - Sara: Do you want to travel only if we have this month is between seeing what is going on?
11/6/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, either way is fine
11/6/19, 19:36 - Sara: If you want to come, for me it’s fine if I know more or less when (to sheddule)
11/6/19, 19:36 - Sara: I’ll try to say it to you at the ens of the week (if forget-i don’t think so- tell me)
11/6/19, 19:37 - Sara: I want to see you, independenty of our fina situation, do you?
11/6/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least that one time, yes, afterwards, I don't know
11/6/19, 19:41 - Sara: Do you have something in mind?
11/6/19, 19:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
11/6/19, 19:42 - Sara: About the trip
11/6/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, not really
11/6/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Berlin?
11/6/19, 19:43 - Sara: Not any place, not any day?
11/6/19, 19:45 - Sara: Mmm i have to see
11/6/19, 19:45 - Sara: There are a couple of free days in Spain, and I can go only those days (december is the last month before exams and classes are finishing)
11/6/19, 19:46 - Sara: I’ll have it a little bit difficult but I can check
11/6/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or I can just try to go to Madrid
11/6/19, 19:47 - Sara: If it is affordable for you it is fine but we can check berlin anyway
11/6/19, 19:51 - Sara: My cheapest flights to Berlin are from the 13th to the 16th, and they cost fron 160€
11/6/19, 19:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: heh, this reminded me of this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkw2rPhAuM
11/6/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: that's a lot
11/6/19, 19:53 - Sara: Mmmm well, a little bit :s
11/6/19, 19:53 - Sara: I was going to say that it was similar to Italy's trip but nop xd
11/6/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: when do you have your break in december again?
11/6/19, 19:54 - Sara: Yes
11/6/19, 19:54 - Sara: 6-9th
11/6/19, 19:54 - Sara: Well, the 6th is free and I don't have classes on mondays
11/6/19, 19:54 - Sara: Maybe 5th is also nice, since I have only one class
11/6/19, 19:55 - Sara: It will be expensive, I see it xD
11/6/19, 19:56 - Sara: I have seen one and costs 115 euros, and the hours are not that bad
11/6/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: maybe Paris, it's a safe place, nothing to lose, if we end up fucked up, at least I already hate Paris so no problem
11/6/19, 19:56 - Sara: HAHAHAHA really?
11/6/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: NO
11/6/19, 19:56 - Sara: XD
11/6/19, 19:57 - Sara: Okay, I thought you were sick xD
11/6/19, 19:57 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can visit Madrid, I would arrive on 1st of december at 15:40 and leave on 4th at 16:35
11/6/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: for 67 euro
11/6/19, 20:00 - Sara: Mmmmm...
11/6/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: or arrive at 1st and leave on 11th for 30 euro, but that's a bit long xd
11/6/19, 20:01 - Sara: Not worth it, because I have class tuesday and wednesday until 5, and a profe
11/6/19, 20:01 - Sara: and projects to present the 3rd and the 11th :s
11/6/19, 20:02 - Sara: Like maybe from wednesday afternoon/evening to monday can be nice
11/6/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I could arrive on 1st or 2nd and leave on 8th
11/6/19, 20:02 - Sara: For how much?
11/6/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: 79 euro
11/6/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: later in december it gets expensive
11/6/19, 20:03 - Sara: Like after the 6th right?
11/6/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: second week of december there are some sort of reasonable, but third and fourth are too much
11/6/19, 20:04 - Sara: Fucking Christmas xd
11/6/19, 20:04 - Sara: I can check in a second which week is better for me
11/6/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I could also come on 6th or 8th
11/6/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: and leave 11th or 13th
11/6/19, 20:05 - Sara: Mmmm

11/6/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't need to spend every minute with you (although I wouldn't mind)
11/6/19, 20:28 - Sara: Well, it’s not about leaving you alone
11/6/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: what then?
11/6/19, 20:30 - Sara: Which ones do you have in mind and I tell you which one could be better
11/6/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, 4th or 6th to arrive and 11th or 13th to leave

11/6/19, 20:32 - Sara: *11th
11/6/19, 20:32 - Sara: And i’d like to say goodbye properly, for instance

11/6/19, 20:34 - Sara: Okay wait a second
11/6/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: mmm, I guess 6th-13th or something like that
11/6/19, 20:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/6/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: but you said the concert is on 11th
11/6/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: and 13th is friday
11/6/19, 20:40 - Sara: Oh i thought it was tuesday :o
11/6/19, 20:40 - Sara: But anyway, it is still there
11/6/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: so what's the issue with 13th?
11/6/19, 20:41 - Sara: Like nothing
11/6/19, 20:42 - Sara: That is fine for you?
11/6/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, it's a bit early but yes
11/6/19, 20:43 - Sara: Mmm  are we sure about all this?
11/6/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: not at all, but maybe something a bit crazy is what we need to finally make some sort of permanent decision
11/6/19, 20:49 - Sara: I want this but i’m fuck afraid at the same time
11/6/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: at this point I'm starting to lose hope I can find any sort of closure for all of this without seeing you in person
11/6/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: and even worse that might not be enough too
11/6/19, 20:51 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/6/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: somehow ending this situation, either leaving for good, being back together or whatever
11/6/19, 20:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: because as I said before, one day I'm sure, the next day I change my mind
11/6/19, 20:53 - Sara: I understand
11/6/19, 20:53 - Sara: Maybe this month can be okay to think
11/6/19, 20:54 - Sara: Like seeing each other can be a good way to be clear right?
11/6/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I hope so
11/6/19, 20:54 - Sara: I hope it is/it is not like Italy
11/6/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: you said you changed, we'll see
11/6/19, 20:55 - Sara: That sounds weird
11/6/19, 20:55 - Sara: I hope you are not here only for judging me
11/6/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: no, I'm not
11/6/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, since Italy I haven't changed much, just more heartbroken
11/6/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I don't know, I think it will be different
11/6/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: but a lot can change during one month
11/6/19, 20:58 - Sara: I agree
11/6/19, 20:58 - Sara: I hope we can enjoy other’s presence and be objective about all this at the same time
11/6/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I only hope that at the end of it I will have some sort of clarity
11/6/19, 20:59 - Sara: Me 2
11/6/19, 20:59 - Sara: Let’s be positive
11/6/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: take your time and tell me later how you want to spend this month of waiting
11/6/19, 21:00 - Sara: Okay
11/6/19, 21:00 - Sara: Will you buy the tickets soon?
11/6/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably right now, the prices change quite quickly
11/6/19, 21:01 - Sara: Okay wait

11/6/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that wasn't a serious statement xd
11/6/19, 23:33 - Sara: Not kidding, when I was “depressed” i felt weak af
11/6/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes but this time it's because I went to the trampoline park

11/6/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eee, no, I still don't know why it was hurting before, I just know why now
11/6/19, 23:36 - Sara: Okay!
11/6/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing, I guess it's just been a long time and maybe I did too much

11/7/19, 01:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/7/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: it wasn't a suicide attempt but a murder attempt, so not exciting at all

11/7/19, 01:27 - Sara: Xd
11/7/19, 01:27 - Sara: 💋
11/7/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, not exactly right now...
11/7/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 07:50 - Sara: In a month xd
11/7/19, 10:06 - Sara: By the way
11/7/19, 10:06 - Sara: About the places to visit
11/7/19, 10:07 - Sara: We will visit Madrid for sure
11/7/19, 10:07 - Sara: Then I’d recommend Toledo (bear Madrid, easy to visit, beautiful and we have my house so it’s basically free)
11/7/19, 10:08 - Sara: And then I know that there are places we can go by bus
11/7/19, 10:09 - Sara: Avila and Segovia are near (less than 1:30h)
11/7/19, 10:09 - Sara: Also, Granada but it’s almost 6h by bus
11/7/19, 10:09 - Sara: If you have any city or monumenrs in mind, you tell me
11/7/19, 10:10 - Sara: I can organise the week a little bit
11/7/19, 10:31 - Sara: And Alcalá de Henares is near Madrid, if you want to check it as well
11/7/19, 10:33 - Sara: Other places are Tablas de Daimiel and Lagunas de Ruidera but maybe it’s a lit far and cold
11/7/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really care that much about traveling around a lot
11/7/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: We'll see how it goes
11/7/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have your classes so I don't want you to neglect that
11/7/19, 10:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you are able to organize it reasonably, that's great but don't worry too much
11/7/19, 11:28 - Sara: We can travel from friday to sunday somewhere else, and then when I have class we visit Madrid
11/7/19, 11:28 - Sara: Up to you :)
11/7/19, 11:28 - Sara: I can give you ideas
11/7/19, 11:29 - Sara: If you come, I want you to enjoy it in many ways :)
11/7/19, 11:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌝
11/7/19, 11:31 - Sara: HAHAHAHA as well
11/7/19, 11:31 - Sara: We will see 😎
11/7/19, 17:48 - Sara: Btw, I forgot to tell you
11/7/19, 17:48 - Sara: I'd like to keep in touch
11/7/19, 17:49 - Sara: Maybe it is about not implying an emotional aspect, but at the same time i'll be unavoidable
11/7/19, 17:49 - Sara: To stay as much neutral as possible
11/7/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
11/7/19, 17:50 - Sara: See everything and everybody in a broader perspective
11/7/19, 17:50 - Sara: But I think if they happen, they'll happen
11/7/19, 17:51 - Sara: Because that is also a proof
11/7/19, 17:52 - Sara: Or what do you think?
11/7/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is this the answer to that question or something else?
11/7/19, 17:53 - Sara: Yes
11/7/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's not really a trust building choice but ok, I understand
11/7/19, 17:54 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/7/19, 17:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: That it is a very neutral decision that doesn't make me trust you more (we already established before that lack of trust is an issue we have now) but I understand it and it's ok
11/7/19, 17:58 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, I'll listen to it later, ok? I'm in the cinema
11/7/19, 17:59 - Sara: Don’t worry, have fun ^^
11/7/19, 17:59 - Sara: I can write it
11/7/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm a bit busy
11/7/19, 17:59 - Sara: Okay, I understand it
11/7/19, 18:00 - Sara: I supposed that if you talked to me it was because you were free
11/7/19, 18:00 - Sara: Sorry
11/7/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem, don't worry
11/7/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: The movie hasn't started yet, there are still commercials
11/7/19, 18:05 - Sara: Which movie is it?
11/7/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Joker
11/7/19, 18:07 - Sara: Nice, you’ll tell me ^^
11/7/19, 18:07 - Sara: I’ll go to the cinema as well
11/7/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now?
11/7/19, 18:08 - Sara: Nop, at 8:30
11/7/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: What movie?
11/7/19, 18:09 - Sara: Portrait of a Lady on Fire
11/7/19, 19:10 - Sara: I have organized something, i’ll tell you later
11/7/19, 20:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course it's a lesbian movie xd
11/7/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now you trust me again? Why?
11/7/19, 20:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I understand your reasons
11/7/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's fine, it just doesn't make me feel any better about us, that's all
11/7/19, 22:46 - Sara: You made me a spoiler :(
11/7/19, 22:46 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/7/19, 22:46 - Sara: Yes and no
11/7/19, 22:46 - Sara: Reason? Love probably
11/7/19, 22:47 - Sara: I easily open my mind with you
11/7/19, 22:47 - Sara: In tha case I still having trust
11/7/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't really expect you to trust me, I want to try to win the trust back, with more than words
11/7/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: But again, my trust for you is also not really there now
11/7/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't believe that you decided to go see a movie without knowing that 😂
11/7/19, 22:49 - Sara: Noam told me to go
11/7/19, 22:50 - Sara: I thought it was only artistic
11/7/19, 22:50 - Sara: But it is better 💕
11/7/19, 22:50 - Sara: I really liked it
11/7/19, 22:50 - Sara: The colours, the hidden meanings, the plof
11/7/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I read about it briefly, it won some awards and overall seems like a pretty good movie
11/7/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although I have to admit that it's not really my kind of movie, lesbian or not, so I would be a bit bored 😁
11/7/19, 22:53 - Sara: Have you watched the trailer?
11/7/19, 22:54 - Sara: No Iron man so 😑
11/7/19, 22:54 - Sara: It is similar to The Art of Loving
11/7/19, 22:54 - Sara: “Similar”, same topic
11/7/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it would be Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans instead of some boring women then I would watch it
11/7/19, 22:54 - Sara: Boring?
11/7/19, 22:55 - Sara: They were french
11/7/19, 22:55 - Sara: But it was nice
11/7/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, women are boring xd
11/7/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Even worse
11/7/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't ever compare it, Art of loving was 🇵🇱
11/7/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: So much better
11/7/19, 22:56 - Sara: Only about love, marriage and children ughhh
11/7/19, 22:56 - Sara: That males it worse
11/7/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: *females
11/7/19, 22:57 - Sara: Ha ha
11/7/19, 22:57 - Sara: Good point
11/7/19, 22:57 - Sara: Everyhing that is not guardians of galaxy is boring right?
11/7/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I recently gave you quite a lot of titles that were not superhero movies
11/7/19, 22:58 - Sara: True
11/7/19, 22:59 - Sara: I hope i have time to watch them
11/7/19, 22:59 - Sara: But idk if they are my kind
11/7/19, 22:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe some of them, hard to tell
11/7/19, 23:00 - Sara: I don’t even know what kind of movies i like
11/7/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you can watch 15 minutes, take a nap, another 15 minutes and so on...
11/7/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:01 - Sara: With you i watched the whole movie
11/7/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because it was about sex...
11/7/19, 23:02 - Sara: Not only on that xd
11/7/19, 23:02 - Sara: I watched the one about nazis directed by Tarantino
11/7/19, 23:02 - Sara: I don’t remember the name in English
11/7/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Inglorious Basterds
11/7/19, 23:03 - Sara: Yep
11/7/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, so your interests are sex, Franco and nazis
11/7/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough
11/7/19, 23:03 - Sara: That’s my best description c:
11/7/19, 23:03 - Sara: *killing nazis
11/7/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Sex with nazis~
11/7/19, 23:04 - Sara: Best type of porn
11/7/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Or with Franco~
11/7/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mixing your favorite things, nice
11/7/19, 23:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:05 - Sara: So predictable
11/7/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about googling some movies that might fit your interests but I'm too afraid
11/7/19, 23:09 - Sara: Surprise me
11/7/19, 23:09 - Sara: Why afraid? XD
11/7/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some things cannot be unseen
11/7/19, 23:10 - Sara: I’m not only an antifascist feminist bisexual xd
11/7/19, 23:10 - Sara: Porn is bad, Kamil
11/7/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I didn't mean to look for porn
11/7/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe a fascist romantic comedy
11/7/19, 23:11 - Sara: I know 😂 You know I don’t like scary movies (?
11/7/19, 23:11 - Sara: Probably there will be one
11/7/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:14 - Sara: Xddd
11/7/19, 23:14 - Sara: Mentioning it just in case xd
11/7/19, 23:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, you are an antifascist feminist bisexual drummer, I think that's about all
11/7/19, 23:16 - Sara: Oh! True that something was missing xd
11/7/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: So yes, now the description is full
11/7/19, 23:17 - Sara: You are Polish 🤗
11/7/19, 23:17 - Sara: ☺☺☺
11/7/19, 23:17 - Sara: I want to watch Whiplash again :;((
11/7/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, I suppose then there is one more combination ~sex with drums~
11/7/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's probably a pretty niche genre of movies
11/7/19, 23:18 - Sara: ~Drums with sex? 🤔~
11/7/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe nazi drummers?
11/7/19, 23:18 - Sara: 🧠💥
11/7/19, 23:18 - Sara: Please
11/7/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Nazis having sex on drums?~
11/7/19, 23:19 - Sara: ~Female nazis having sex on drums?~
11/7/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like a male drum and a female drum?
11/7/19, 23:20 - Sara: I was thinking about a human and a drum ser
11/7/19, 23:20 - Sara: Set*
11/7/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Bisexual nazis having sex with feminist drums?~
11/7/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Telling from experience?
11/7/19, 23:20 - Sara: Oscar
11/7/19, 23:20 - Sara: No.. of course not.....
11/7/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you brave enough to Google it?
11/7/19, 23:21 - Sara: Of course
11/7/19, 23:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed, from experience
11/7/19, 23:24 - Sara: Drummer are so bad at sex ugh
11/7/19, 23:24 - Sara: Drummers*
11/7/19, 23:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not if you're a furry
11/7/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Back at home?
11/7/19, 23:26 - Sara: Yes, a long time ago
11/7/19, 23:26 - Sara: But this is not for today
11/7/19, 23:26 - Sara: But as if it were
11/7/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, even if you're not wearing it, I think you still have it on, it's not just an outfit, it's a mindset
11/7/19, 23:28 - Sara: I’m a 🐧
11/7/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will think about this photo next time I get an unwanted erection
11/7/19, 23:28 - Sara: If it is unwanted, why would you think about having it? 🤔
11/7/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I will think about that photo so that it goes away
11/7/19, 23:30 - Sara: Perfect
11/7/19, 23:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, it's quite nice, I have a Sara photo for every mood now
11/7/19, 23:31 - Sara: Excellent
11/7/19, 23:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, yes, after examining the photo I can conclude that it is quite Sara
11/7/19, 23:32 - Sara: Why?
11/7/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I recognized a familiar looking collar bone
11/7/19, 23:34 - Sara: Do I have a specific one?
11/7/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
11/7/19, 23:35 - Sara: Girls are so used to compliments xd
11/7/19, 23:35 - Sara: Nice one
11/7/19, 23:35 - Sara: Didn’t know that
11/7/19, 23:36 - Sara: Xddd
11/7/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, yes, returning to the topic, I think this is a person
11/7/19, 23:37 - Sara: Maybe she’s a ghost
11/7/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, kind of looks a bit fuzzy, but that might be because of the shaky hands of an alcoholic
11/7/19, 23:38 - Sara: 🍷
11/7/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still, nice boobs, so that's a plus
11/7/19, 23:39 - Sara: Hypersexualizing ghost? So bad Kamil
11/7/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Necrophilia~
11/7/19, 23:40 - Sara: How can you fuck something it doesn’t exist?
11/7/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hypersexualizing? And if I say nice eyebrows is it also Hypersexualizing?
11/7/19, 23:41 - Sara: Obviously
11/7/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my mind, of course
11/7/19, 23:42 - Sara: That your mind doesn’t exist, you said?
11/7/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, you have very fuckable eyebrows
11/7/19, 23:42 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:46 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I said eyebrows, not eyebrow, learn your English, muy mal
11/7/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:50 - Sara: Sorry master😭😭😭
11/7/19, 23:50 - Sara: Stop, it is exciting mee
11/7/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wonder if someone ever tried that, like you can fuck boobs but can you fuck eyebrows?
11/7/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like I'm discovering new lands
11/7/19, 23:52 - Sara: 🤔
11/7/19, 23:52 - Sara: Welcome to the perverted world, my friend
11/7/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: There seems to be a hole of some sort so...
11/7/19, 23:54 - Sara: Sperm shots yay
11/7/19, 23:55 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, I realize that all of this is probably not neutral, sorry
11/7/19, 23:56 - Sara: It is okay
11/7/19, 23:56 - Sara: Don’t worry
11/7/19, 23:56 - Sara: It’s funny :)
11/7/19, 23:56 - Sara: It happened
11/7/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 23:57 - Sara: Aw 💕
11/7/19, 23:57 - Sara: I love pussies yay
11/7/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, it's licking itself, I bet that yours cannot do that
11/7/19, 23:58 - Sara: Depending on where
11/7/19, 23:58 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Either you just said that you're a pussy or your pussy has some interesting abilities
11/8/19, 00:01 - Sara: Which ones? 💫
11/8/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: If your pussy can lick something, I think that's quite amazing
11/8/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to emphasize, lick, not leak
11/8/19, 00:03 - Sara: Imaging leaking
11/8/19, 00:03 - Sara: It is made for being licked 😎
11/8/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can actually imagine, quite easily xd
11/8/19, 00:05 - Sara: That small is your penis?
11/8/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, but perhaps with practice...
11/8/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, fuckable elements don't necessarily need to be fucked themselves
11/8/19, 00:06 - Sara: Not anal but nosal... okay okay
11/8/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: In a fairly elaborate way, I am complementing some parts of you that perhaps don't get complemented typically, so stop complaining
11/8/19, 00:07 - Sara: https://twitter.com/nosensevideos/status/1192540713289949185?s=21
11/8/19, 00:08 - Sara: You want to make me fuckable in every place 😂
11/8/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I already used the nicer complements before so I wanted to mix things a little bit, I don't remember saying before that you're fuckable
11/8/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also hypersexualizing, obviously
11/8/19, 00:11 - Sara: I know I know
11/8/19, 00:11 - Sara: And thanks for that
11/8/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unexpected
11/8/19, 00:12 - Sara: Am I understanding you?
11/8/19, 00:12 - Sara: Idk
11/8/19, 00:12 - Sara: Maybe my mind is somewhere else
11/8/19, 00:12 - Sara: Sorry
11/8/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem
11/8/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess so, in the end the idea was to make slightly offensive and ridiculous complements
11/8/19, 00:14 - Sara: Then I got it
11/8/19, 00:14 - Sara: Tbh, i’m having a breakdown and i didn’t get the main idea
11/8/19, 00:14 - Sara: Sorry
11/8/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened?
11/8/19, 00:15 - Sara: Anxiety about the whole emotional situation and feelings arrived suddenly
11/8/19, 00:15 - Sara: I don’t know why
11/8/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you need to talk?
11/8/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or just want?
11/8/19, 00:16 - Sara: Should I?
11/8/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not asking if you should but if you want or need
11/8/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if you should
11/8/19, 00:18 - Sara: I don’t know
11/8/19, 00:18 - Sara: It is not your problem how I deal with all this sitatuon, I don’t want you to be bad or influence you
11/8/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it can make things much worse
11/8/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And if we are supposed to try to trust each other, I don't know, maybe that's one way to do it
11/8/19, 00:20 - Sara: That is true
11/8/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: So without that in consideration, do you want it?
11/8/19, 00:21 - Sara: Yes
11/8/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, in a few minutes I should be able
11/8/19, 00:26 - Sara: You tell me
11/8/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now is fine
11/8/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
11/8/19, 09:53 - Sara: I’ll try to have that mood
11/8/19, 09:54 - Sara: And I’ll try to focus on the present
11/8/19, 09:54 - Sara: Thanks for yesterday
11/8/19, 09:54 - Sara: It was so caring and lovable 💕
11/8/19, 09:55 - Sara: I have no words for your effort and dedication :,)
11/8/19, 10:08 - Sara: By the way, the planning I have is this:
Fri 6: You come :) & we stay in Madrid
Sat 7: Turism in Madrid
Sun 8: Mainly I have thought about spending the day in El Escorial and its monastery. Also i thought about going to Segovia (maybe i can send you photos of both places)
Mon 9: Turism in Toledo (one day is enough to see what is important) and we return to Madrid
Tue 10: I go to class and we can spend the afternoon&evening together
Wed 11: Because I have the concert, you can come to uni and then doing something later before I go (unless you want to come 🌚)
Thu 12: I have one class until 12:30, so we can spend also the whole day seeing Madrid or even I can skip it
Fri 13: You leave :(
11/8/19, 10:11 - Sara: Maybe I have doubts about sunday/monday because monuments normally closes on monday so :/

11/8/19, 10:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 12:13 - Sara: Btw, http://www.palaciodehielo.com/pista/
11/8/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sounds good, I like the plan 😊
11/8/19, 13:06 - Sara: Nice ^^
11/8/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: What concert is this btw?
11/8/19, 13:06 - Sara: Ghost ^^
11/8/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are joking about me going, right?
11/8/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are tickets or something, right?
11/8/19, 13:07 - Sara: Yes
11/8/19, 13:07 - Sara: And no, it is a suggestion for you not being alone
11/8/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, but if I don't have a ticket, how can I go?
11/8/19, 13:08 - Sara: But you don’t need to go
11/8/19, 13:08 - Sara: Buying it? XD
11/8/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's still possible?
11/8/19, 13:08 - Sara: But we have time, i’ll think about something
11/8/19, 13:08 - Sara: I think so
11/8/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'll think about it, I wouldn't mind
11/8/19, 13:09 - Sara: ~you wouldn’t mind meeting my parents neither~
11/8/19, 13:09 - Sara: Hahaha
11/8/19, 13:09 - Sara: I’m trying to find the schedule
11/8/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can be incognito, I'll take a hoodie and sunglasses and they will never sse me
11/8/19, 13:10 - Sara: To be an incognito in a mafia family? Ummm
11/8/19, 13:10 - Sara: Not safe
11/8/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: And btw, no problem, de nada 😄
11/8/19, 13:12 - Sara: They open at 6, so maybe it is about 7-8 the first band, 8-9 the second and ghost until 11 approx
11/8/19, 13:13 - Sara: I know my family and they want to enter later (i’m this kind of people who wants to be in the first row) so also gives us time
11/8/19, 13:13 - Sara: 💗
11/8/19, 13:13 - Sara: Did you sleep ~good~?
11/8/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, not bad
11/8/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
11/8/19, 13:14 - Sara: I slept fast, but only for 4 hours, and then i took a 1h nap
11/8/19, 13:14 - Sara: So xd
11/8/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😑
11/8/19, 13:15 - Sara: Ghent memories xd
11/8/19, 13:15 - Sara: I’ll try to sleep a little bit more these days
11/8/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it's fine
11/8/19, 13:16 - Sara: Probably when the dates approaches (or even the day before) we will know it xd
11/8/19, 13:16 - Sara: But yep, i’ll comment today that you are coming
11/8/19, 13:17 - Sara: We won’t sleep in Toledo (although Idk if sleep there because Toledo is really nice at night)
11/8/19, 13:17 - Sara: I’ll schedule more when the date is nearer ;)
11/8/19, 13:17 - Sara: Btw, do you prefer Segovia of the monastery?
11/8/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, I should probably take a look at the tickets
11/8/19, 13:18 - Sara: Idk if they are expensive, but i can help you paying it
11/8/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, I don't know honestly
11/8/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can't do both?
11/8/19, 13:19 - Sara: Ummmm if you prefer Segovia to Toledo, yes
11/8/19, 13:19 - Sara: Or...
11/8/19, 13:20 - Sara: Well, the first saturday...
11/8/19, 13:20 - Sara: But at the same time Madrid is huge
11/8/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, ok, I'll think about it and I'll tell you later
11/8/19, 13:20 - Sara: Yep, don’t worry ^^
11/8/19, 13:20 - Sara: Not in a rush ^^
11/8/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 13:56 - Sara: HAHAHAHA
11/8/19, 13:56 - Sara: That doesn’t happen :(
11/8/19, 14:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I am so sad about that too, being a backpack (or a koala) must be great
11/8/19, 14:01 - Sara: We can try
11/8/19, 14:02 - Sara: But we are similar in height
11/8/19, 14:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 14:03 - Sara: Ay 💕
11/8/19, 14:03 - Sara: In that sense yess
11/8/19, 14:03 - Sara: But not spooning
11/8/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mmm, fair enough
11/8/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this makes more sense as a backpack
11/8/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Emotional baggage~
11/8/19, 14:06 - Sara: Am I? :(
11/8/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: xd
11/8/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you're emotional and I carried you a few times 🐴
11/8/19, 14:07 - Sara: Hahaha
11/8/19, 14:08 - Sara: You ran so fast when you were carrying me xd
11/8/19, 14:08 - Sara: 🇸🇮
11/8/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 14:10 - Sara: I didn’t know you were bluere

11/8/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 14:35 - Sara: I swear that gif is hypnotic
11/8/19, 14:35 - Sara: Well, I have to obey...
11/8/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, that means that we're not pornstars 😢
11/8/19, 14:37 - Sara: Why do you want to be a pornstar? 🤨
11/8/19, 14:37 - Sara: 🤣
11/8/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, everything seems easy in porn, so that's nice
11/8/19, 14:38 - Sara: You want sex easier? 😂
11/8/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, dying is fine
11/8/19, 14:39 - Sara: Best kind of sex
11/8/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~With a happy ending~
11/8/19, 14:40 - Sara: Death?
11/8/19, 14:40 - Sara: XD
11/8/19, 14:40 - Sara: Deathgasm
11/8/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Imagine that you kill someone with your pussy and then the police starts looking for the murder weapon xd
11/8/19, 14:41 - Sara: It’s an excelent plan
11/8/19, 14:42 - Sara: When you are arriving you said?
11/8/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: "deadliest clit in the west"
11/8/19, 14:44 - Sara: It’s fucking cute
11/8/19, 14:44 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAH
11/8/19, 14:44 - Sara: Pam pam!
11/8/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: It kind of looks like a penis
11/8/19, 14:48 - Sara: Because the penis is a prolongation of the clitoris xD
11/8/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know
11/8/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which means that you have a small dick, hahaha
11/8/19, 14:49 - Sara: Nop
11/8/19, 14:49 - Sara: Rather you’d have a long clitoris
11/8/19, 14:50 - Sara: And our clitoris has more sensibility 😎
11/8/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, it's just a cowardly penis, it's hiding
11/8/19, 14:52 - Sara: It’s get bigger :P
11/8/19, 14:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 14:54 - Sara: Not a good adventurer...
11/8/19, 14:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: My machete wasn't very sharp
11/8/19, 14:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's more like a mace rather than a machete
11/8/19, 15:00 - Sara: Why a mace? XD
11/8/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:02 - Sara: Wait
11/8/19, 15:02 - Sara: Are you referring to your penis? Xd
11/8/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: aaaaah, you're so slow xd
11/8/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: please, what else could it be?
11/8/19, 15:03 - Sara: Tongue? 🤔
11/8/19, 15:03 - Sara: Your penis has nothing to do with this hahaha
11/8/19, 15:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, perhaps I should try next time
11/8/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good point, but also not sharp enough
11/8/19, 15:05 - Sara: Adventure time yay
11/8/19, 15:05 - Sara: Nop
11/8/19, 15:05 - Sara: What would you compare it with? XD
11/8/19, 15:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: a whip maybe????
11/8/19, 15:06 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:06 - Sara: Well, it doesn’t help
11/8/19, 15:06 - Sara: Hurt* haha
11/8/19, 15:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:07 - Sara: And on fire hahaha
11/8/19, 15:07 - Sara: But you don’t do that movement xd
11/8/19, 15:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: first chillie, than oral
11/8/19, 15:08 - Sara: Mexican food? XD
11/8/19, 15:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: a burrito
11/8/19, 15:09 - Sara: But a happy one this time
11/8/19, 15:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I certainly hope so 😊
11/8/19, 15:10 - Sara: 🤗
11/8/19, 15:10 - Sara: If you come, i won’t be sad
11/8/19, 15:10 - Sara: Or i hope not
11/8/19, 15:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:12 - Sara: Xd
11/8/19, 15:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, I will crash the plane in your house, it will save me the costs of travelling from the airport
11/8/19, 15:14 - Sara: Plane is also a metaphor?
11/8/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:15 - Sara: Sad :(
11/8/19, 15:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: why, that way I'll arive faster xd
11/8/19, 15:17 - Sara: True
11/8/19, 15:17 - Sara: Maybe too much sex xD
11/8/19, 15:19 - Sara: Plane crushing to my house... 🤔
11/8/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You would be famous, I'm sure that never happened in Madrid before
11/8/19, 15:28 - Sara: Having a building on fire because of a plane
11/8/19, 15:28 - Sara: ?
11/8/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
11/8/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did any planes ever crash in Madrid?
11/8/19, 15:30 - Sara: Mmmmm good question
11/8/19, 15:30 - Sara: Not like 9/11
11/8/19, 15:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be 6/12, a new version
11/8/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't quite sound as good as 9/11 though
11/8/19, 15:31 - Sara: Yes...
11/8/19, 15:31 - Sara: Ans destroying houses are not good
11/8/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not?
11/8/19, 15:33 - Sara: Where are you going to stay then? :(
11/8/19, 15:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm sure that some part of the plane will be intact
11/8/19, 15:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can improvise myself a shelter from the debris
11/8/19, 15:34 - Sara: I hate planes ugh
11/8/19, 15:34 - Sara: XD
11/8/19, 15:34 - Sara: So bad Kuzniak
11/8/19, 15:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: De la Torrism bitch
11/8/19, 15:35 - Sara: You and Nicco arr still having that club right?
11/8/19, 15:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Por supuesto que sí
11/8/19, 15:39 - Sara: Crying in Spanish
11/8/19, 15:39 - Sara: How dare you
11/8/19, 15:39 - Sara: I’m lovable :(
11/8/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: *fuckable
11/8/19, 15:40 - Sara: 🌝
11/8/19, 15:40 - Sara: Dirty boy
11/8/19, 15:40 - Sara: 🌚
11/8/19, 15:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm obviously referring to the eyebrows
11/8/19, 15:42 - Sara: I was thinking about the nose
11/8/19, 15:42 - Sara: It can be funnier
11/8/19, 15:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Mmmm
11/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: It can fit
11/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: It is not that deep
11/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Maybe it fits perfectly for you
11/8/19, 15:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was curious if you would guess what it is xd
11/8/19, 15:47 - Sara: Belly button right?
11/8/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, of course, that's why I like it
11/8/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/8/19, 15:48 - Sara: I can recognize parts of my body xd
11/8/19, 15:48 - Sara: Finally you admit you have it small
11/8/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never said otherwise
11/8/19, 15:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you were actually the one that wanted to measure it
11/8/19, 15:49 - Sara: I’m curious about this kind of things xD
11/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: You should be happy ^^
11/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: Maybe i’m doing jokes that I should’t do
11/8/19, 15:53 - Sara: Sorry 🙏🏻
11/8/19, 15:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I don't mind
11/8/19, 15:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your dick is smaller anyway, so I'm fine
11/8/19, 15:55 - Sara: I have just realized that i would’t like to receive comments like that, maybe you neither
11/8/19, 15:55 - Sara: Froid? That’s you?
11/8/19, 15:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't like when someone tells you you have a small dick?
11/8/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, I don't care, I know what I have so anybody's comment don't really hurt me
11/8/19, 15:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Especially when I know that it's just jokes
11/8/19, 15:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😁
11/8/19, 15:57 - Sara: I’m proud of what I have ahha
11/8/19, 15:57 - Sara: Okay, just in case
11/8/19, 15:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem
11/8/19, 15:59 - Sara: Why am I so sensitive? XD
11/8/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think it's good to realize that, I don't mind, but there are probably many people who would be offended
11/8/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: So no problem here
11/8/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless you refer to something else now?
11/8/19, 16:01 - Sara: True, i don’t normally do them, idk why I can joke with you easily
11/8/19, 16:02 - Sara: But i don’t want to hurt
11/8/19, 16:02 - Sara: I was dancing and I had to stop because I was feeling weird about my body, so I transfered it to the conversation
11/8/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why you were feeling weird?
11/8/19, 16:06 - Sara: I don’t know, but i shouldn’t give too much importance to something so superficial
11/8/19, 16:06 - Sara: I’m afraid of not dancing good, that’s it
11/8/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's why you practice, to get better
11/8/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Remember that no matter how you dance, you will always do it better than me
11/8/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😉
11/8/19, 16:08 - Sara: Hahahaha
11/8/19, 16:08 - Sara: Challenge me xD
11/8/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would need to see how you dance first
11/8/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I distinctly remember that at one point you really wanted to twerk in front of me, but you never did 😢
11/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: I have to have my dance finished when you are in Spain so i’ll show you
11/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: And I still want :B
11/8/19, 16:10 - Sara: Why didn’t I? :(
11/8/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know 😭
11/8/19, 16:12 - Sara: But I admit that I liked going to twitch for dancing closer with you
11/8/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😘
11/8/19, 16:14 - Sara: It’s true
11/8/19, 16:14 - Sara: Like... you feel something different when you do it
11/8/19, 16:14 - Sara: 💋
11/8/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know it's true
11/8/19, 16:31 - Sara: ^^
11/8/19, 16:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/8/19, 19:28 - Sara: I answer here
11/8/19, 19:29 - Sara: But what kind of nervousness?
11/8/19, 19:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, what will happen, is this really a good idea, that sort of thing
11/8/19, 19:32 - Sara: And now what do you think?
11/8/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I'm not going to change my mind, I want to go and I will, but I am a bit afraid
11/8/19, 19:38 - Sara: Change in your mind?
11/8/19, 19:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean about going or not
11/8/19, 19:42 - Sara: I think both of us are afraid
11/8/19, 19:43 - Sara: It’s not use worrying
11/8/19, 19:43 - Sara: Despite what happens, I’ll enjoy being with you while you are here, and also while talking this time
11/8/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, if you will feel bad and you will want to talk, just tell me, I hope that yesterday I at least convinced that you can do that without a problem
11/8/19, 19:49 - Sara: Thanks sweetie 💕
11/8/19, 19:50 - Sara: The same for you
11/8/19, 19:50 - Sara: Of course, yesterday was fine :)
11/9/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 02:30 - Sara: Hahahahaa
11/9/19, 02:30 - Sara: Sara and anger? That is weird
11/9/19, 02:30 - Sara: By the way
11/9/19, 02:31 - Sara: It could be nice if you learn to play any song with the guitar
11/9/19, 02:31 - Sara: 🤗♥💫
11/9/19, 08:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you mention this?
11/9/19, 08:44 - Sara: Because I remember you saying that it could be nice play a sing together :)
11/9/19, 08:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?

11/9/19, 08:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, nothing unusual
11/9/19, 08:46 - Sara: Why are you awake now?
11/9/19, 08:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I simply woke up
11/9/19, 08:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why again? xd
11/9/19, 08:47 - Sara: I went out and i didn’t arrive to home until  4 xd
11/9/19, 08:47 - Sara: Also I needed someone to take me by car to my house again and well... xd
11/9/19, 08:48 - Sara: I’m easy to distract xD
11/9/19, 08:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure if I understood, but why did you wake up so soon then?
11/9/19, 08:49 - Sara: Oh
11/9/19, 08:49 - Sara: I didn’t say it
11/9/19, 08:50 - Sara: That was why i arrived late
11/9/19, 08:50 - Sara: I wake up soon to take the bus to Madrid and rehearsal with the band
11/9/19, 08:50 - Sara: We are in the rehearsal room from 10-13h
11/9/19, 08:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that I'm not sure about the meaning of this, but nevermind
11/9/19, 08:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are crazy, I would sleep until 12 xd
11/9/19, 08:52 - Sara: Oh, like... i can think “okay, i’ll arrive at home around 2 because I need to sleep”
11/9/19, 08:52 - Sara: But then because i’m having fun I arrive later xd
11/9/19, 08:52 - Sara: Duties 🤷🏽‍♀
11/9/19, 08:52 - Sara: And you know, i’ll sleep when I die

11/9/19, 08:56 - Sara: You will save the day I see ^^
11/9/19, 08:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't really have many plans, I'm still a bit sore after the trampoline Park so I'm not doing that much
11/9/19, 08:57 - Sara: But exactly when did you go? One/two weeks ago?
11/9/19, 08:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: On Wednesday
11/9/19, 08:58 - Sara: Oh, I thought it was longer time ago
11/9/19, 08:58 - Sara: In that case, don’t force your body
11/9/19, 08:59 - Sara: I hope I can see you doing that 😎
11/9/19, 08:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: There probably is a place like that in Madrid, no?
11/9/19, 08:59 - Sara: I’m sure ^^
11/9/19, 08:59 - Sara: I haven’t searched for one
11/9/19, 09:00 - Sara: #far xD
11/9/19, 09:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I checked the tickets for Ghost and it's around 40 euro
11/9/19, 09:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: So quite nice
11/9/19, 09:01 - Sara: I thought you were going to ser the opposite xd
11/9/19, 09:01 - Sara: Well, for 3 bands acting... it’s really nice
11/9/19, 09:02 - Sara: So what do you think?
11/9/19, 09:02 - Sara: Although idk if sleeping in the bus now
11/9/19, 09:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you want me to go?
11/9/19, 09:02 - Sara: Why not?
11/9/19, 09:02 - Sara: I mean, what is the use of being alone at home?
11/9/19, 09:03 - Sara: I prefer you being in the concert with my family and me
11/9/19, 09:03 - Sara: Also I really like their show, i’m sure you will like it as well
11/9/19, 09:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, seems nice
11/9/19, 09:04 - Sara: Cool 😎

11/9/19, 09:06 - Sara: I’ll go to sleep problably now
11/9/19, 09:06 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHA 🐼

11/9/19, 09:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I knew that you party quite a bit but I didn't know that you party that hard xd

11/9/19, 09:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Explains everything
11/9/19, 09:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: 4 hours of sleep makes sense now

11/9/19, 09:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 09:54 - Sara: Why? If that car is horrible xd
11/9/19, 09:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ugly
11/9/19, 09:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But surprisingly useful
11/9/19, 09:55 - Sara: And why?
11/9/19, 09:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I just heard so, fortunately I never had one xd
11/9/19, 09:56 - Sara: Saving money for a car?
11/9/19, 09:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean one of these
11/9/19, 09:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, I don't need it very much right now
11/9/19, 09:57 - Sara: I know
11/9/19, 10:05 - Sara: Well, if you want to go to  a different country xd
11/9/19, 20:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😾

11/9/19, 20:16 - Sara: well, i had the rehearsal and then I was doing uni stuff
11/9/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, do you finally have a name?
11/9/19, 20:17 - Sara: Yes hahaha
11/9/19, 20:18 - Sara: Probably we will be Rey Amarillo
11/9/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yellow 🤮
11/9/19, 20:18 - Sara: Best colour ever haha
11/9/19, 20:19 - Sara: But it’s from a book
11/9/19, 20:19 - Sara: Called The King in Yellow
11/9/19, 20:19 - Sara: 🤴
11/9/19, 20:19 - Sara: Xd
11/9/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:20 - Sara: Queen is picked :(
11/9/19, 20:21 - Sara: Queen in yellow :p
11/9/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sacrilege
11/9/19, 20:21 - Sara: https://youtu.be/foS1bG8p2K0
11/9/19, 20:21 - Sara: Why? Queen in gold :=
11/9/19, 20:21 - Sara: :p
11/9/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Gold is not yellow, woman, please, you're supposed to be good with colors
11/9/19, 20:22 - Sara: Maybe you like this kind of videos https://youtu.be/0-gPcpDgeI4
11/9/19, 20:22 - Sara: Meh, men, so simple
11/9/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least I see the difference between golden and yellow
11/9/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: #delatorrism
11/9/19, 20:23 - Sara: There is
11/9/19, 20:23 - Sara: But c’mone
11/9/19, 20:23 - Sara: It can be a sort of metaphor
11/9/19, 20:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like your king is yellow because he is broke and cannot afford gold?
11/9/19, 20:24 - Sara: Yes, he is painted in yellow
11/9/19, 20:24 - Sara: And he looks better
11/9/19, 20:25 - Sara: :B
11/9/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:27 - Sara: What’s wrong with orange?
11/9/19, 20:27 - Sara: :((( xd
11/9/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because of America I have bad feelings about orange painted men
11/9/19, 20:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Other than that nothing wrong xd
11/9/19, 20:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:28 - Sara: Maybe he’s wearing make up 🤷🏽‍♀
11/9/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, he actually is, he's not so orange naturally
11/9/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are pictures where you can see where that paint, makeup whatever ends and his natural color starts and it's ridiculous
11/9/19, 20:30 - Sara: Paint, makeup whatever hahaha
11/9/19, 20:30 - Sara: I haven’ts notices xd
11/9/19, 20:30 - Sara: Btw, did you know that tomorrow there are elections in Spain? XD
11/9/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/9/19, 20:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've read about it somewhere a few weeks ago
11/9/19, 20:31 - Sara: First time voting in Spain yay
11/9/19, 20:31 - Sara: We are fucked up
11/9/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't be so happy, in the next few months you'll probably vote at least 2 or 3 more times xd
11/9/19, 20:33 - Sara: If you have time and you are iinterested, there is a video in this article about the fear I have xd https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50257922
11/9/19, 20:33 - Sara: I hope not xd
11/9/19, 20:34 - Sara: But I'm a lit scared, not lying
11/9/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I actually don't know how is rape defined in polish law
11/9/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, that sounds so ridiculous
11/9/19, 20:35 - Sara: Here there is difference between abuse and rape
11/9/19, 20:35 - Sara: Abuse without intimidation, and rape with it
11/9/19, 20:35 - Sara: It is absurd
11/9/19, 20:35 - Sara: In both you feel indimidated xd
11/9/19, 20:35 - Sara: Intimidated
11/9/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed, especially since it doesn't take into account when the victim is unconscious
11/9/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I guess it is possible to drug someone and rape them and technically it won't be a rape in Spain? Do I understand that correctly?
11/9/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: You refer to that article or something else?
11/9/19, 20:38 - Sara: I think that’s what happened
11/9/19, 20:38 - Sara: To what can happen in Spanish politics
11/9/19, 20:38 - Sara: ~Vox~
11/9/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Start learning a new language (or consider Mexico) 😅
11/9/19, 20:39 - Sara: x)))))) Sad but true
11/9/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Polish is quite nice, you can consider
11/9/19, 20:40 - Sara: ~Why going to Poland if you are not there?~ It could be possible
11/9/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I had no clue that the law in Spain is that stupid
11/9/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: But probably not only there
11/9/19, 20:40 - Sara: Everywhere
11/9/19, 20:40 - Sara: And Vox wants to remove the gender violence law xd
11/9/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~I don't know where I'll be yet~ Remember, cheap alcohol
11/9/19, 20:41 - Sara: 🍺
11/9/19, 20:41 - Sara: Well, not emoji shot
11/9/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: You would be know as Sara "The Red Woman"
11/9/19, 20:42 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think that's also a character in Game of Thrones so that's actually kind of nice
11/9/19, 20:43 - Sara: Why red?
11/9/19, 20:43 - Sara: Oh
11/9/19, 20:43 - Sara: Wait xd
11/9/19, 20:43 - Sara: 🍅 xd
11/9/19, 20:43 - Sara: I prefer being red for communism hahaha
11/9/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can be the flag
11/9/19, 20:44 - Sara: How?
11/9/19, 20:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:45 - Sara: xd
11/9/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Impalement*
11/9/19, 20:47 - Sara: That’s you
11/9/19, 20:47 - Sara: Please, don’t change roles
11/9/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember impaling, I don't remember ever being impaled myself
11/9/19, 20:48 - Sara: Depending on your conception of impaling
11/9/19, 20:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think by any conception, I was never impaled 🙄
11/9/19, 20:49 - Sara: But you are Kamil the Impaled
11/9/19, 20:50 - Sara: I’m sure you have been impaled
11/9/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least you learned how to spell it properly xd
11/9/19, 20:50 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 20:51 - Sara: Impaling, nice comparison
11/9/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it kind of works, in the medieval times they used slightly longer pales but the main idea is similar
11/9/19, 20:52 - Sara: Longer? I don’t think so
11/9/19, 20:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that is very kind of you to say, but come on, I'm not so well endowed
11/9/19, 20:53 - Sara: 😂
11/9/19, 20:53 - Sara: I always say the same
11/9/19, 20:54 - Sara: ~it’s about thinkness~ The key is to know how to move it
11/9/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you never measured it and you didn't have glasses so I can understand the mistake
11/9/19, 20:55 - Sara: Well, do ypu underestimate me?
11/9/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your measurement skills? Perhaps
11/9/19, 20:56 - Sara: Mmmmmm yes, I suppose
11/9/19, 20:57 - Sara: Btw, would you like to do somthing later? I’m not sure because some friends are coming, but it’s mainly my sister’s so probably I can be free later (if i don’t go out)
11/9/19, 20:57 - Sara: It’s raining ugh
11/9/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I don't mind
11/9/19, 20:57 - Sara: I can tell you ^^
11/9/19, 20:58 - Sara: Why don’t you trust me? Xddd
11/9/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: That joke doesn't feel so funny to me these days 😔
11/9/19, 20:59 - Sara: Sorry
11/9/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry
11/9/19, 20:59 - Sara: Idk, my perception is not my mistake
11/9/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm flattered 🤭
11/9/19, 21:01 - Sara: Hahahaha
11/9/19, 21:01 - Sara: Idk sex is not only about that
11/9/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't need to tell me that
11/9/19, 21:02 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/9/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: That I know that quite well
11/9/19, 21:02 - Sara: Okay just in case
11/9/19, 21:03 - Sara: I don’t want you to be bad for that
11/9/19, 21:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, it's easy to joke about dicks
11/9/19, 21:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: About the rest, not so much
11/9/19, 21:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: So dick jokes it is xd
11/9/19, 21:03 - Sara: Why? XX
11/9/19, 21:04 - Sara: XD
11/9/19, 21:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have you ever heard anybody joke about the size of the ~pseudo-penis~ clitoris?
11/9/19, 21:05 - Sara: Not at all xD
11/9/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly
11/9/19, 21:05 - Sara: We are not so egocentric as cismen
11/9/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are just jealous
11/9/19, 21:06 - Sara: Please, I know you are Sigmond Froid
11/9/19, 21:06 - Sara: Get out of this conversation please xd
11/9/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 21:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/9/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a side note, because I see this once again, it's Freud, not Froid, please, it's painful to see xd
11/9/19, 21:08 - Sara: I hate him
11/9/19, 21:08 - Sara: I don’t need to spell properly his name
11/9/19, 21:08 - Sara: Only in my gender studies exam xd
11/9/19, 21:08 - Sara: He doesn’t deserve it pls
11/9/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: So envious
11/9/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't like Germans?
11/9/19, 21:09 - Sara: Do you?
11/9/19, 21:09 - Sara: 😁
11/9/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some of them

11/9/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ciao 🖐️

11/9/19, 22:00 - Sara: Okay?
11/9/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm listening to the Fiesta Pagana and it makes me want to dance around a bonfire xd

11/9/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't have the bonfire 😢
11/9/19, 22:03 - Sara: Mago has better songs xD
11/9/19, 22:03 - Sara: Madrid on fire 🔥
11/9/19, 22:04 - Sara: They have a song called Vodka and roll hahaha
11/9/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: They must be from the north
11/9/19, 22:05 - Sara: Nop
11/9/19, 22:05 - Sara: Madrid mainly
11/9/19, 22:05 - Sara: But they have a cd related to Galicia called Finisterra
11/9/19, 22:05 - Sara: It’s a nice cd
11/9/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since they are Spanish and not from the Basque country I'm pretty sure that this is very fake and they don't really drink vodka
11/9/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Basques are the only Spaniards I respect
11/9/19, 22:07 - Sara: Aitor xd
11/9/19, 22:07 - Sara: Where is he? XD
11/9/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably drinking or cutting some cars in half
11/9/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or terrorizing the vikings
11/9/19, 22:50 - Sara: Or drinking for a whole week xd
11/9/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably all of the above, at the same time
11/9/19, 23:06 - Sara: He can, he is vasque

11/10/19, 02:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or at least Italian or something
11/10/19, 02:16 - Sara: I’m too difficult x)
11/10/19, 02:16 - Sara: But who wants to be those nationalities? Xd
11/10/19, 02:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Better question is who wants to be Spanish?
11/10/19, 02:17 - Sara: ...
11/10/19, 02:17 - Sara: Yeah, fair enough
11/10/19, 02:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at least you're not french so that's something

11/10/19, 16:33 - Sara: Creo que lo dije 🤔
11/10/19, 16:33 - Sara: Examen de orina
11/10/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yo sé
11/10/19, 16:33 - Sara: Posible infección
11/10/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, sí, recuerdo
11/10/19, 16:33 - Sara: 👌🏻 (you wanted to say “lo sé?)
11/10/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
11/10/19, 16:34 - Sara: They want my pee xd

11/10/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, vale
11/10/19, 16:36 - Sara: ^^
11/10/19, 16:36 - Sara: También que prefiero estar en Madrid, en mi propia habitación
11/10/19, 16:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Puedo entender eso muy bien. Ya no te gusta tu familia? 😁
11/10/19, 16:46 - Sara: La quiero mucho ♥
11/10/19, 16:46 - Sara: Pero me gusta tener espacio propio
11/10/19, 16:46 - Sara: Mi habitación en Madrid me recuerda a Gante, es 100% yo
11/10/19, 16:46 - Sara: Ya verás 😊
11/10/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maravilloso, habitación soviética ❤️
11/10/19, 16:48 - Sara: Jajajajaja
11/10/19, 16:48 - Sara: Con bandera comunista
11/10/19, 16:48 - Sara: (Ok, no)
11/10/19, 16:48 - Sara: El techo es blanco, eso si :(
11/10/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/10/19, 17:12 - Sara: Best flag ever
11/10/19, 17:12 - Sara: Afte Spanish one
11/10/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/10/19, 17:16 - Sara: HAHAHAHA
11/10/19, 17:16 - Sara: Yes
11/10/19, 17:16 - Sara: Best of both worlds
11/10/19, 18:32 - Sara: Do you want me to tell you when I finish having dinner and we call? ^^
11/10/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, if my internet won't work well enough then maybe we will have to try a bit later but we'll see
11/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: Okay
11/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: Disadvantages of living in a hut
11/10/19, 18:39 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/10/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think I always expressed my deep-rooted hatred for this place, so yes, quite awful xd
11/10/19, 18:48 - Sara: Really? I didn’t know thaaaat
11/10/19, 18:48 - Sara: XD
11/10/19, 18:49 - Sara: But better than Ghent’s room
11/10/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in Ghent I had fairly good connection at least
11/10/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also if it wasn't satisfactory I just used my bike 🚲
11/10/19, 18:50 - Sara: Is it dangerous using it there?
11/10/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that if the internet connection wasn't good enough I could always go see you in person
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: Oh hahaha
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: True
11/10/19, 18:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, there just isn't anything interesting to go to
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: Or the opposte
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: Opposite
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: But you didn’t invite me :(
11/10/19, 18:51 - Sara: Only once and because I had to haha
11/10/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: There was not much reason to, your room was better xd
11/10/19, 18:52 - Sara: True
11/10/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: And typically closer when returning from the center
11/10/19, 18:52 - Sara: Excuses excuses ;)
11/10/19, 18:53 - Sara: Mine was more tidy too xd
11/10/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, especially the sticky floor
11/10/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very nice, I could have nice grip on the floor when pushing you against the wall
11/10/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good forward thinking Sara
11/10/19, 18:55 - Sara: I was thinking about everything
11/10/19, 18:55 - Sara: I care, of course
11/10/19, 18:58 - Sara: You are not so considerate :,(
11/10/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I couldn't afford to have a sticky floor, in the end I needed some place to sleep, you know...
11/10/19, 18:59 - Sara: You loved the floor
11/10/19, 18:59 - Sara: Not only for sleeping...
11/10/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I didn't care, but your neighbor did...
11/10/19, 19:17 - Sara: It was mutual, so there is peace between us
11/10/19, 19:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/10/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: What, I didn't know that you were sensitive about your floor, sorry xd
11/10/19, 19:19 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/10/19, 19:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I only meant that I didn't care if it was on the bed or on the floor
11/10/19, 19:20 - Sara: Well, if had been alone, me too xd
11/10/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Poor Blanca, I never cared about her sleep, I feel bad now 😞
11/10/19, 19:22 - Sara: Because you weren’t using your brain in that moment exactly 😂
11/10/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you were?
11/10/19, 19:22 - Sara: Yes and no
11/10/19, 19:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>

11/10/19, 21:57 - Sara: Btw, I have had dinner
11/10/19, 21:58 - Sara: I'm watching the TV for the results
11/10/19, 21:58 - Sara: You tell me when you have conection
11/10/19, 21:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can probably try now if you feel like
11/10/19, 21:59 - Sara: I tell you when I can call you, but not too late
11/10/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: From what I'm seeing vox has over twice as many seats than in the previous election
11/10/19, 22:00 - Sara: xdddddddddddddddd
11/10/19, 22:01 - Sara: I'm shitting in the shit right now
11/10/19, 22:01 - Sara: in the milk
11/10/19, 22:01 - Sara: HAHAHAHA
11/10/19, 22:01 - Sara: well, vox is shit so more or less
11/10/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buy yourself a gun or something xd
11/10/19, 22:02 - Sara: This is not US, Kamil
11/10/19, 22:02 - Sara: In this case, I wish but nop xd
11/10/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, México then?
11/10/19, 22:03 - Sara: Mmmm Maybe Spain and Mexico are similar
11/10/19, 22:03 - Sara: xD
11/10/19, 22:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then maybe Chile?
11/10/19, 22:04 - Sara: Almost
11/10/19, 22:04 - Sara: We don't lose eyes xd
11/10/19, 22:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it makes you feel any better, I was pretty disappointed with the results of the polish election too
11/10/19, 22:05 - Sara: Why?
11/10/19, 22:05 - Sara: Later I'll tell you the situation but xd incredible
11/10/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, we can discuss it when we call
11/10/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't feel like writing everything
11/10/19, 22:06 - Sara: Okay, fair enough
11/10/19, 22:06 - Sara: Do you normally vote?
11/10/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course
11/10/19, 22:07 - Sara: I had a discussion about that
11/10/19, 22:07 - Sara: and now i'm thinking
11/10/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can discuss that too
11/10/19, 22:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although for me it's pretty obvious
11/10/19, 22:08 - Sara: Nice ^^
11/10/19, 22:14 - Sara: I’m connecting now

11/11/19, 10:15 - Sara: Having a shower
11/11/19, 10:15 - Sara: Not having stability
11/11/19, 10:15 - Sara: As always
11/11/19, 10:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Slippery shower?
11/11/19, 10:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you should make your floor sticky like in Ghent
11/11/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't realize until now that you had that way probably to improve your overall stability, nice
11/11/19, 10:18 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/11/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's harder to fall when the floor is sticky
11/11/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: (I know that's not the kind of stability you meant xd)
11/11/19, 10:23 - Sara: Xd
11/11/19, 10:23 - Sara: Boys’ inestability sucks
11/11/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I prefer standing firmly on the ground
11/11/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a more serious note, is everything alright?
11/11/19, 10:26 - Sara: No...
11/11/19, 10:26 - Sara: But I should focus on tomorrow exam
11/11/19, 10:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened?
11/11/19, 10:26 - Sara: If I knew
11/11/19, 10:26 - Sara: Guada...
11/11/19, 10:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need to talk?
11/11/19, 10:28 - Sara: Maybe later
11/11/19, 10:28 - Sara: I need to revise for the exam and to find out what happened

11/11/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that recently it's been rather difficult, for me too
11/11/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: So don't worry
11/11/19, 10:39 - Sara: It is like...
11/11/19, 10:39 - Sara: I try to do my best for being okay with people and seems difficult
11/11/19, 10:40 - Sara: And also I don’t to be sad with you everyday
11/11/19, 10:40 - Sara: I don’t to be sad in general xd
11/11/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it is difficult, not everything and everyone is compatible
11/11/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: At some point it can be difficult to stay in touch, especially when there is a lot of history between two people
11/11/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you did your best, you shouldn't worry much about it
11/11/19, 10:42 - Sara: If a person has a wrong conception about me...
11/11/19, 10:42 - Sara: Yes, that worries
11/11/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I told you before that actions are more convincing than words so maybe that gives a different perspective on you than you think
11/11/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, everyone interprets stuff in their own way
11/11/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's probably different than yours
11/11/19, 10:44 - Sara: Idk know
11/11/19, 10:44 - Sara: 🙁
11/11/19, 10:44 - Sara: Idk what I do
11/11/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you need to talk, I can, just remember that
11/11/19, 10:46 - Sara: Okay thanks
11/11/19, 10:46 - Sara: Sorry I need to focus
11/11/19, 10:46 - Sara: Talk to you later and work well with yout thesis
11/11/19, 10:46 - Sara: 💋
11/11/19, 10:47 - Sara: But that makes me feel they are mistreating me
11/11/19, 10:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe from their perspective you mistreat them?
11/11/19, 10:47 - Sara: 🤷🏽‍♀
11/11/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I have no details whatsoever so I'm just shooting in the dark
11/11/19, 10:48 - Sara: I have done my best and people seems to treat me like rubbish
11/11/19, 10:48 - Sara: That is what happened three times so xd
11/11/19, 10:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, once again
11/11/19, 10:49 - Sara: Thanks thanks
11/11/19, 10:49 - Sara: I know I talk al lot
11/11/19, 10:49 - Sara: I should focus on the study
11/11/19, 10:49 - Sara: Bye and thanks 💕
11/11/19, 10:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in that case, study hard and don't worry, I'll be here if you need me 🤗
11/11/19, 10:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 10:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 10:54 - Sara: Thanks 😭❤
11/11/19, 14:19 - Sara: Hey ❤ I'm better, I think I was getting distracted by doing uni stuff and having lunch
11/11/19, 14:21 - Sara: I don't know what is going on with Guada. He didn't talked to me for about 2 weeks and I assumed I wasn't part of his life as before, so I accepted it (Also, I have a mirror effect on people). And today and yesterday he started to say that he was upset with me for a behaviour I used to have and because I didn't worry about us
11/11/19, 14:21 - Sara: Okay, I had to admit that certain insecurities and problems led me to feel bad with myself when he mentioned Raquel; bu now I have been going through to so many shit that I don't care at all about anything indeed
11/11/19, 14:22 - Sara: We want to solve the situation but Idk what is in his mind, because I apologized and told him I'm the first one who wants to be okay with him
11/11/19, 14:23 - Sara: And it's true I have forgotten about telling him about what is happening with me (he sent me a message but I prefered to put my question aside) but he wasn't interested at all at meeting or talking to me
11/11/19, 14:24 - Sara: He gave me some stickers and okay, that is a good present, but he didn't care about me
11/11/19, 14:24 - Sara: Idk
11/11/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps he still hasn't dealt with the situation, break ups are tough, one day it feels like you have everything under control, and the next one you feel lost and hurt again, I don't know what's going through his mind but it's probably nothing pleasant
11/11/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if he doesn't really want your help, what can you do? I don't think you should worry too much. Perhaps over time it will simply get better, I personally don't think that there is that much that you can do about it
11/11/19, 14:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: He will either come around on his own or not at all probably
11/11/19, 14:27 - Sara: He says he cannot say anything about his new life because I get angry when he is happy
11/11/19, 14:27 - Sara: And I was like (?)
11/11/19, 14:27 - Sara: I don't know, but I think he is blaming me
11/11/19, 14:28 - Sara: And judging me for a behaviour I used to have
11/11/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's possible, but again, what more can you do?
11/11/19, 14:28 - Sara: And it's not fair
11/11/19, 14:29 - Sara: It is like your situation, and see how it is going
11/11/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: He will probably have to deal with his feelings by himself and then maybe you can have a healthy friendship again or something
11/11/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have a lot of history together so I imagine that it can be overwhelming
11/11/19, 14:30 - Sara: I understand
11/11/19, 14:30 - Sara: But it is like Cristina's case, idk
11/11/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, because it is difficult
11/11/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think that most couples don't stay in touch a lot after breaking up
11/11/19, 14:30 - Sara: That means people doesn't want to solve anything
11/11/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or they don't know how
11/11/19, 14:31 - Sara: But we were quite nice and then I said something weird, and he is like that now
11/11/19, 14:31 - Sara: Idk
11/11/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, one day feels like running away, the next one feels like running back
11/11/19, 14:32 - Sara: I don't understand people
11/11/19, 14:32 - Sara: Yes..
11/11/19, 14:32 - Sara: Well, he told me something about his felinos towards me... probably it is confusion
11/11/19, 14:32 - Sara: felinos JAJAJA
11/11/19, 14:32 - Sara: feelings*
11/11/19, 14:33 - Sara: But it is frustrating that both people want the same and his behaviour is like that
11/11/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 14:33 - Sara: Okay, maybe I was a little bit rude discussing about politics
11/11/19, 14:33 - Sara: But Idk
11/11/19, 14:34 - Sara: He didm't ask about my perspective of everything
11/11/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you really know what he wants?
11/11/19, 14:34 - Sara: He told me, be okay as friends
11/11/19, 14:34 - Sara: So do I
11/11/19, 14:34 - Sara: ❤
11/11/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, but is that really what he wants or he just said that because it seems right?
11/11/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: because I think that it's easier said than done, tbh
11/11/19, 14:35 - Sara: Well... maybe he wasn't feeling good about me having other
11/11/19, 14:35 - Sara: relations
11/11/19, 14:36 - Sara: But he is with Raquel, sort of
11/11/19, 14:36 - Sara: So I assumed he accepted the situation
11/11/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Feelings and relations can be far more complex unfortunately
11/11/19, 14:36 - Sara: idk, he said as well he is still in love with me and that was weird
11/11/19, 14:37 - Sara: Maybe that is why wants to do his own life further?
11/11/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, if he does still love but cannot or doesn't want to be back together, I think it's understandable that he is a mess right now
11/11/19, 14:37 - Sara: Okay, maybe it was more complex than expected
11/11/19, 14:38 - Sara: Yes..
11/11/19, 14:39 - Sara: I was afraid of losing contact for having different couples, and maybe he interpreted if he is with another person, I'll be gone
11/11/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: who knows, maybe he is with her to try to forget the feelings for you
11/11/19, 14:39 - Sara: He told me he really likes her, so I don't think so
11/11/19, 14:39 - Sara: Having felinos from different people is normal
11/11/19, 14:39 - Sara: fucking felinos haha
11/11/19, 14:39 - Sara: feelings*
11/11/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, than maybe that makes everything even more difficult for him, having *felinos* for two people at the same time
11/11/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 14:41 - Sara: Xd
11/11/19, 14:41 - Sara: I understand him af
11/11/19, 14:41 - Sara: But you don’t need to chose
11/11/19, 14:41 - Sara: Choose*
11/11/19, 14:42 - Sara: Unless you are thinking about having a close relationship
11/11/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: you think so?
11/11/19, 14:42 - Sara: But yes, probably they are not fond of that neither
11/11/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: exactly
11/11/19, 14:42 - Sara: I used to have problems with that until I had to think about that
11/11/19, 14:42 - Sara: Or I have it(? Idk
11/11/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I look at it from that perspective because I don't want an open relationship either
11/11/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: and from what I remember of her behavior, Raquel also doesn't
11/11/19, 14:44 - Sara: Well, she was uneasy with the idea of us being a couple for a long time and being that close
11/11/19, 14:44 - Sara: But probably I don’t make her feel secure
11/11/19, 14:46 - Sara: I’m a problematic shit xd
11/11/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 14:53 - Sara: 💕
11/11/19, 14:54 - Sara: But i don’t know what i’m doing wrong or right
11/11/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think when feelings or even a relationship comes into play, many people are not happy with polygamy
11/11/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know I am not and most people I know are neither
11/11/19, 14:55 - Sara: I’m not into polygamy neither but yes, I understand your point
11/11/19, 14:55 - Sara: Maybe i thought he got over it, and he didn’t
11/11/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so, it's what I told you earlier
11/11/19, 14:56 - Sara: Yes...
11/11/19, 14:56 - Sara: 😖😖😖
11/11/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: but then again, I'm just speculating, I've never even seen the man in my life so don't take my opinions as given, people are complex so maybe it's something completely different
11/11/19, 14:58 - Sara: But seems so
11/11/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: yes, it does seem like the most probable reason
11/11/19, 14:58 - Sara: Why life is complex?
11/11/19, 14:58 - Sara: And why people don’t say the truth?
11/11/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: trust issues?
11/11/19, 14:59 - Sara: 🤷🏽‍♀
11/11/19, 14:59 - Sara: Idk
11/11/19, 15:00 - Sara: So manu things
11/11/19, 15:00 - Sara: Many*
11/11/19, 15:00 - Sara: I should revise again for a little bit
11/11/19, 15:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will go running, I should be back in more or less 30 minutes
11/11/19, 15:02 - Sara: Ok don’t worry
11/11/19, 15:02 - Sara: Enjoy
11/11/19, 15:02 - Sara: And thanks
11/11/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I don't feel very helpful but you're welcome
11/11/19, 15:02 - Sara: You literally gave me the whole perspective
11/11/19, 15:03 - Sara: So you have been helpful
11/11/19, 15:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: cool, if this whole engineering thing doesn't work out I have a new carrer path ready 😊
11/11/19, 15:04 - Sara: Yay
11/11/19, 15:04 - Sara: My psychologist ☺☺☺💫💫💫💫
11/11/19, 15:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 15:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 15:51 - Sara: How was it?
11/11/19, 15:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: pretty good, I feel like I'm starting to get back in shape, much better then in Ghent
11/11/19, 15:52 - Sara: Good!
11/11/19, 15:52 - Sara: And why now?
11/11/19, 15:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you mean?
11/11/19, 15:54 - Sara: Oh okay i underatand
11/11/19, 15:54 - Sara: Like you have been running and today you especially feel in shape
11/11/19, 15:54 - Sara: That is so good
11/11/19, 15:54 - Sara: I should dance, I forgot today ><
11/11/19, 15:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: when I was running a bit in Ghent I was much slower and much more tired, now it feels pretty good
11/11/19, 15:57 - Sara: Nicee
11/11/19, 15:57 - Sara: How much did you run?
11/11/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: today not so much, just 6km, last week I felt bold so I did 10km and it actually went quite well
11/11/19, 15:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: so I will probably repeat it soon
11/11/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am running to make my heart stronger so that it can fit more love xd
11/11/19, 16:00 - Sara: Such a runner
11/11/19, 16:01 - Sara: Oh, you have heart? I didn’t know that :p
11/11/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: fit more love for food of course, don't get any wrong ideas
11/11/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you now?
11/11/19, 16:03 - Sara: 🥟 💕
11/11/19, 16:03 - Sara: I’m better

11/11/19, 16:03 - Sara: And i’m dancing
11/11/19, 16:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: btw, what is that stuff from instagram?
11/11/19, 16:03 - Sara: Probably i’ll show it to you in person haha
11/11/19, 16:03 - Sara: What exactly?
11/11/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: the slow sex thing
11/11/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: good, don't even think about stopping 😊
11/11/19, 16:05 - Sara: HAHAHAHA a raffle
11/11/19, 16:05 - Sara: I hope not :p
11/11/19, 16:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: ¿Qué?
11/11/19, 16:07 - Sara: Ummmm
11/11/19, 16:07 - Sara: You try to win a prize
11/11/19, 16:08 - Sara: Yes, that kind  of stuff
11/11/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, but what is the prize?
11/11/19, 16:08 - Sara: That, it’s a brand of erotic products
11/11/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, that's what I was asking from the beginning
11/11/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: So nothing specific?
11/11/19, 16:10 - Sara: Mmmmm some of their products
11/11/19, 16:10 - Sara: I tried some and damn
11/11/19, 16:11 - Sara: They had samples in the erotic shop near my home hahaha
11/11/19, 16:12 - Sara: In fact, they are all of them xD
11/11/19, 16:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 17:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, seems less potato-like than usually, good job
11/11/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
11/11/19, 17:24 - Sara: Now I’m a blue one
11/11/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Right, sorry
11/11/19, 17:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💜
11/11/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: More appropriate
11/11/19, 17:25 - Sara: Not blue heart?
11/11/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, that's not blue
11/11/19, 17:26 - Sara: What is it then? Xd
11/11/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at least on the photo looks more like that one
11/11/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💙 This one, not really
11/11/19, 17:26 - Sara: It is dark blue :p
11/11/19, 17:27 - Sara: Darker ^^
11/11/19, 17:27 - Sara: But yep
11/11/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, I obviously picked the sexual heart 💜
11/11/19, 17:29 - Sara: 🌝
11/11/19, 17:29 - Sara: Hahaha so rare on you :p
11/11/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Going out?
11/11/19, 17:30 - Sara: Yes but a lit later
11/11/19, 17:30 - Sara: I’m going to buy some seeds
11/11/19, 17:31 - Sara: And i have bought the patches
11/11/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, have fun then
11/11/19, 17:36 - Sara: Thanksss
11/11/19, 17:37 - Sara: You have any plan?
11/11/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, I'll just try to finish the theoretical part of the thesis
11/11/19, 17:37 - Sara: Nice 💫💫💫
11/11/19, 17:37 - Sara: You can do it ^^
11/11/19, 22:35 - Sara: Hey Kamil ☺
11/11/19, 22:35 - Sara: How are you? I don’t know if going to sleep soon, I think I should. I don’t want to be a zombie 🧟‍♀
11/11/19, 22:37 - Sara: But I wanted you to know you have been an amazing and caring person these days, and I really like talking to you. I feel that my trust is growing and that is really nice 🤗
11/11/19, 22:39 - Sara: You were there when I needed and you are putting effort to make this work, and that I appreciate it A LOT
11/11/19, 22:40 - Sara: So thanks a lot 😊
11/11/19, 22:41 - Sara: I’m looking forward to see you here
11/11/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thank you, I'm trying my best. You're back home so soon? Are you ill? 😉
11/11/19, 22:42 - Sara: I came one hour after
11/11/19, 22:42 - Sara: Not ill but my friend needed to go
11/11/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not so nervous anymore?
11/11/19, 22:43 - Sara: I’ll be nervous, believe me
11/11/19, 22:43 - Sara: Maybe in another sense
11/11/19, 22:43 - Sara: Idk if more or less than in Italy
11/11/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to talk, it's ok for me but perhaps you should sleep more, you have an exam tomorrow 🤗
11/11/19, 22:44 - Sara: You?
11/11/19, 22:45 - Sara: (i think it is tomorrow but maybe it’s on Wednesday xd)
11/11/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I'm still feeling pretty shaky, we'll see how it goea
11/11/19, 22:45 - Sara: Until 11? 🙏🏻
11/11/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't need to go to sleep early, so your choice 😊
11/11/19, 22:46 - Sara: Understandable
11/11/19, 22:46 - Sara: Maybe via whatsapp is okay
11/11/19, 22:46 - Sara: How was you evening?
11/11/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not so good, after I returned from my run I started feeling a bit sick
11/11/19, 22:47 - Sara: Cold? :(
11/11/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure why, I've been running during much worse weather and it was perfectly fine
11/11/19, 22:48 - Sara: Everything can be possible
11/11/19, 22:48 - Sara: Take care of yourself 💕
11/11/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was checking the forecast and it seems that it's actually a bit colder in Madrid
11/11/19, 22:49 - Sara: Ha
11/11/19, 22:49 - Sara: HAAAAAA
11/11/19, 22:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is this bullshit, it's supposed to be hot
11/11/19, 22:49 - Sara: bitch pls
11/11/19, 22:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 22:49 - Sara: And in december?
11/11/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I checked just this week
11/11/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't trust the forecast for a month ahead
11/11/19, 22:50 - Sara: You told me so
11/11/19, 22:51 - Sara: When i went out it wasn’t that bae
11/11/19, 22:51 - Sara: Bad
11/11/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I said colder, I didn't say cold 😂
11/11/19, 22:51 - Sara: :(
11/11/19, 22:51 - Sara: But it is
11/11/19, 22:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perdona pero no xd
11/11/19, 22:52 - Sara: I’m starting to close my eyes a bit xd
11/11/19, 22:52 - Sara: Ehhhh
11/11/19, 22:53 - Sara: If is colder than in poland...
11/11/19, 22:54 - Sara: I’m thinkimg about sleeping
11/11/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But Poland is not cold, please
11/11/19, 22:54 - Sara: I’m starting to chane words xd
11/11/19, 22:54 - Sara: Change*
11/11/19, 22:54 - Sara: It is!
11/11/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 22:55 - Sara: Go naked, and check it
11/11/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at least it's warmer than Spain
11/11/19, 22:55 - Sara: Xddx
11/11/19, 22:56 - Sara: Literally me
11/11/19, 22:56 - Sara: I will go to sleep, if you don,t mind
11/11/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, the shape is quite similar, resemblance is uncanny ❤️
11/11/19, 22:57 - Sara: Also the fur xd
11/11/19, 22:57 - Sara: ❤
11/11/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenas noches y dulces sueños 😊
11/11/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nos vemos mañana
11/11/19, 22:57 - Sara: Hasta mañana :)
11/11/19, 22:58 - Sara: Descansa 😘
11/11/19, 22:58 - Sara: ☺☺☺
11/12/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hello there 👋
11/12/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: How did the exam go?
11/12/19, 18:13 - Sara: Hey!
11/12/19, 18:13 - Sara: Quite shitty
11/12/19, 18:13 - Sara: It was quite an easy test and that asshole always makes the exams difficult
11/12/19, 18:14 - Sara: But it is okay, 4 exams are only a 20-30%
11/12/19, 18:14 - Sara: How are you?
11/12/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
11/12/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine, still feeling a bit sick but nothing serious
11/12/19, 18:15 - Sara: Help me from this semantic dragon xD
11/12/19, 18:15 - Sara: What do you feel?
11/12/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's probably just cold, overall just kind of tired
11/12/19, 18:17 - Sara: Be careful :S
11/12/19, 18:17 - Sara: Have a worm soup 🍲
11/12/19, 18:17 - Sara: What did you do?
11/12/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Worm? That's not very vegan, is it?
11/12/19, 18:18 - Sara: Warm xD for god sake
11/12/19, 18:18 - Sara: But you can also eat it
11/12/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mostly working on the thesis, I want to finish the theoretical part today
11/12/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, first draft of it
11/12/19, 18:18 - Sara: Although we both know vegan soups are your battery charger
11/12/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: *magic soups
11/12/19, 18:19 - Sara: Yep, you told me! I hope you finished tonight
11/12/19, 18:19 - Sara: But vegan right?
11/12/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure that one in Ljubljana wasn't, the one in Zagreb I think also not
11/12/19, 18:20 - Sara: :,(
11/12/19, 18:20 - Sara: I thought so
11/12/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't mind
11/12/19, 18:20 - Sara: I see that you don’t care
11/12/19, 18:20 - Sara: Probably you’d eat vegan for a week so :p
11/12/19, 18:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If the taste is fine I definitely don't care what is my food made of
11/12/19, 18:21 - Sara: Excellent 🤗
11/12/19, 18:21 - Sara: I know some places with vegan Spanish food so 👌🏻
11/12/19, 18:22 - Sara: So will you be vegetarian or vegan? 😏
11/12/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably not, I eat whatever is convenient at the moment
11/12/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vegan surely not, cheese is life, cheese is love
11/12/19, 18:23 - Sara: There is vegan cheese :B
11/12/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤢
11/12/19, 18:24 - Sara: What is convenient?
11/12/19, 18:24 - Sara: 😔
11/12/19, 18:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: At home right now, for sure vegan or vegetarian would be very difficult to do
11/12/19, 18:24 - Sara: Because of your family?
11/12/19, 18:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: After I move out, we'll see
11/12/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, most of the time I don't cook so I don't really have much choice
11/12/19, 18:25 - Sara: Cool 😎
11/12/19, 18:25 - Sara: True but you can decide i suppose
11/12/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think I will be fully vegetarian but I can probably eat meat less
11/12/19, 18:26 - Sara: It is okay to reduce
11/12/19, 18:26 - Sara: But better to cut it down 😎
11/12/19, 18:26 - Sara: I’m thinking now that my transition was quite long
11/12/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I prefer to at least keep it an option when I go to a dinner with someone or to try some traditional stuff during travels
11/12/19, 18:28 - Sara: But animals, environment and health :,(
11/12/19, 18:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Personally, I believe that the actual, visible positive effect on environment can mostly come from the governments, individual impact seems quite limited to me
11/12/19, 18:30 - Sara: Yes and no
11/12/19, 18:30 - Sara: Offer and supply
11/12/19, 18:30 - Sara: If we don’t contribute, they won’t polute
11/12/19, 18:30 - Sara: So both interventions are important
11/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: Ours and theirs
11/12/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that sense, yes, but that would require action on a really big scale
11/12/19, 18:31 - Sara: There are many veggie  people
11/12/19, 18:32 - Sara: Or a lot of people that reject these kid of business
11/12/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if such initiative can reach large enough scale to make an impact just by the individual choice
11/12/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe, over time, with education
11/12/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: You know that I am personally all in on everyone having a choice and not enforcing anything
11/12/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at the same time, that approach takes a lot of time to change something
11/12/19, 18:47 - Sara: I answer you later ^^
11/12/19, 19:26 - Sara: That makes it faster and maybe it is the best
11/12/19, 19:26 - Sara: But again, it is not only one person but hundreds
11/12/19, 19:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hundreds or thousands when you need millions
11/12/19, 19:26 - Sara: Vegans have done a lot in not so much time (more vegan restaurants and options to eat)
11/12/19, 19:27 - Sara: But again, impact is huge
11/12/19, 19:27 - Sara: When I started, nobody knew about veganism
11/12/19, 19:27 - Sara: And now it is well known
11/12/19, 19:27 - Sara: (But this is about everything)
11/12/19, 19:28 - Sara: And what about if your choice hurts others? Racism, sexism, specism is not a choice
11/12/19, 19:28 - Sara: And in the case it is veery slow, it is about following ethics and be in favour of your own principles
11/12/19, 19:28 - Sara: I really hate people that know that something is bad and still doing it
11/12/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, maybe anything was not the right word
11/12/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at the same time, if you ban racism, sexism and everything else, it doesn't really make racists suddenly not racist
11/12/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: They cannot show it publicly, which is not a bad thing but it doesn't really change the cause of the problem, rather just treats the symptoms
11/12/19, 19:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't get me wrong, I do  think that these things should be punished
11/12/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just don't think it's enough
11/12/19, 19:42 - Sara: Yes, of course
11/12/19, 19:42 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/12/19, 19:42 - Sara: I thing being an example for the people helps a lot
11/12/19, 19:43 - Sara: Because you are the theory put into practice
11/12/19, 19:43 - Sara: Even if you are only one
11/12/19, 19:43 - Sara: I know that I have influenced people, as well as others have influenced me
11/12/19, 19:44 - Sara: Both are equally important
11/12/19, 19:44 - Sara: Although one is faster than other
11/12/19, 19:45 - Sara: I know that with my actions i’m saving many animals per year, that I’m helping other women or i’m showing that bisexuality is normal
11/12/19, 19:45 - Sara: Even if I’m only one
11/12/19, 19:45 - Sara: But i know i’m not alone
11/12/19, 19:46 - Sara: That is my perspective
11/12/19, 19:46 - Sara: And I don’t like when people say “i don’t do X because it is not changing anything”
11/12/19, 19:51 - Sara: Just an opinion ^^
11/12/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't judge you or guilt trip you on anything that you do, so please don't try to do that to me, it certainly won't lead to anything good
11/12/19, 20:04 - Sara: I just gave my opinion :/
11/12/19, 20:04 - Sara: Sorry if you felt attacked
11/12/19, 20:06 - Sara: I feel embarrased now
11/12/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I respect you, your choices and opinions, I hope that you respect mine too
11/12/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing is set in stone, as my life changes, mu choices can evolve too
11/12/19, 20:11 - Sara: I know
11/12/19, 20:11 - Sara: I didn’t say the opposite
11/12/19, 20:11 - Sara: I have just said my opinion
11/12/19, 20:14 - Sara: I wasn’t born like this neither
11/12/19, 20:17 - Sara: Again, sorry
11/12/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I'm not trying to shame you or anything, since you just said it, be considerate and more careful, persuasion is an art, if you make the other person feel like you are superior in some way, I'm afraid it's not a very effective way to convince anybody
11/12/19, 20:18 - Sara: I haven’t been convincing you of anything, that wasn’t my intention
11/12/19, 20:19 - Sara: Just i’m too passionate for this things xd
11/12/19, 20:19 - Sara: I was talking about this as about my fav book
11/12/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure that when you convinced some people you influenced them in a more friendly way, not by arguing or anything of that sort
11/12/19, 20:19 - Sara: Again
11/12/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply by showing what you do for example, on Instagram or otherwise or answering questions, just have that in mind
11/12/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, I'm not angry, I'm just giving you my opinion now
11/12/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do with it what you want
11/12/19, 20:21 - Sara: Okay
11/12/19, 20:21 - Sara: I need my time, i’m a little bit sensitive
11/12/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you need to talk, I'm here
11/12/19, 20:23 - Sara: It is okay, it is just that I’m feeling a little bit bad about this
11/12/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why exactly?
11/12/19, 20:37 - Sara: Don’t want to be misunderstood
11/12/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm fine, I understand and I'm not angry at you or anything
11/12/19, 20:38 - Sara: Sure?
11/12/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, I'm not so fragile, we can have discussions, it won't make me suddenly hate you
11/12/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, hate you more 😊
11/12/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Because as you remember I hate you the least~
11/12/19, 20:46 - Sara: You looked too concerned
11/12/19, 20:46 - Sara: Okay, fair enough 😌
11/12/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in any sort of relation, I never expect it to be always perfect, disagreements happen and I know better than to dwell on them too much
11/12/19, 20:49 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/12/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I accept that arguments and some unpleasantries happen and I don't give too much weight too them
11/12/19, 20:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, if bad stuff happens like, every day, than it's a reason to be concerned
11/12/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise, not really
11/12/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm telling you this because I remember than back in Ghent any time I was angry with you for a moment you felt quite bad about it
11/12/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you shouldn't be so worried
11/12/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if you improved on that matter or not, in Florence you were quite sad after our little accident 🌝 so perhaps not
11/12/19, 20:56 - Sara: Which one?
11/12/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bed accident xd
11/12/19, 20:57 - Sara: I'm a bit because I don't want people to think about me something which is not true
11/12/19, 20:57 - Sara: I don't remember
11/12/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehh xd
11/12/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~The oral accident~
11/12/19, 21:04 - Sara: Oh
11/12/19, 21:04 - Sara: Well, i will try to change it
11/12/19, 21:04 - Sara: I don’t want to let people down or something like that
11/12/19, 21:05 - Sara: Especially with you that the situation is tense when it cones of what is going on
11/12/19, 21:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think it's good for your mental health
11/12/19, 21:06 - Sara: I cannot control it, so i’ll try to change it
11/12/19, 21:06 - Sara: True xd
11/12/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at least in my case, unless we start to argue all the time, I don't have any problem and I don't think any less of you
11/12/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that was an example of a bit of an overreaction from you which I think is not good for you, because that accident was really nothing serious and actually kind of funny
11/12/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overreaction in the sense that you felt much worse about it then you should, in my opinion
11/12/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: if you have time later and you feel like, we can make a call or something
11/12/19, 21:10 - Sara: Firstly you looked angry
11/12/19, 21:10 - Sara: Okay ^^
11/12/19, 21:10 - Sara: Sorry for that
11/12/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't need to be sorry
11/12/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's just something that will probably make you unhappy in the long term, unless someone stays angry for long, you shouldn't worry, I think you could benefit from that
11/12/19, 21:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something to consider, self-care
11/12/19, 21:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me if or when you want
11/12/19, 21:51 - Sara: okay :)
11/12/19, 21:51 - Sara: I'm doing it more than ever
11/12/19, 21:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me alegro mucho 😊
11/12/19, 21:57 - Sara: Gracias ❤
11/12/19, 22:09 - Sara: Are you available?

11/13/19, 09:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Excuse me? 🤔
11/13/19, 09:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I see that you are in good mood in the morning, making jokes and all
11/13/19, 09:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can agree that it is also "Kamil trying to pronounce spanish" xd

11/13/19, 21:00 - Sara: How can I remove you from this conversation as in whatsapp groups?

11/13/19, 21:00 - Sara: Such a bad joke xD
11/13/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 21:03 - Sara: Where is Miguelangelo one when I need it?

11/13/19, 21:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Curiosidad, nada más 😋
11/13/19, 21:15 - Sara: Yes

11/13/19, 22:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, mujer
11/13/19, 22:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or niña maybe?
11/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: Up to you boy :p
11/13/19, 22:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'll stick with Sara de la Torre de la Mancha
11/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: That’s Nicco’s
11/13/19, 22:20 - Sara: Xd
11/13/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing Sara de la Torre de la Mancha?
11/13/19, 22:21 - Sara: I’m revising for the test tomorrow
11/13/19, 22:21 - Sara: And also talking with Ricardo
11/13/19, 22:21 - Sara: I’m a lit concern
11/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
11/13/19, 22:22 - Sara: I feel partially used, but I shouldn’t
11/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why used?
11/13/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dime más
11/13/19, 22:23 - Sara: I told you he has been absent these days right?
11/13/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/13/19, 22:24 - Sara: He has issues with his ex
11/13/19, 22:24 - Sara: He commented me something but i didn’t know he was too concerned about that
11/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: And well, when she entered again in his life, he started talking to me less and that kind of stuff
11/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: He wants me as a friend as that is really nice, so do I
11/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: But the feeling is there
11/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: Of being used or something
11/13/19, 22:25 - Sara: Maybe he was making up his mind but idk
11/13/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess you didn't really commit to anything more so I can't really blame him, but at the same time I understand you too
11/13/19, 22:26 - Sara: Well, at least I could stop on time I guess(?
11/13/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe both of you needed a break from your exes
11/13/19, 22:27 - Sara: I’m sure he needs it
11/13/19, 22:27 - Sara: Do I?
11/13/19, 22:28 - Sara: Me neither but it is like... weird
11/13/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know, I hope not anymore, but before, like a few weeks ago, I imagine that yes
11/13/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I needed it too
11/13/19, 22:28 - Sara: But I appreciate the space he took to me to realise about stuff
11/13/19, 22:28 - Sara: Yes
11/13/19, 22:29 - Sara: At the same time, insecurities are coming. People treat me right when they want something?
11/13/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I know that feel
11/13/19, 22:30 - Sara: 🙁
11/13/19, 22:30 - Sara: It sucks
11/13/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm afraid that in many cases it is that way, but I hope that there are at least some people that are different
11/13/19, 22:30 - Sara: Is that the majority? Xd
11/13/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my personal experience, yes
11/13/19, 22:31 - Sara: Like I hate when things are not reciprocate
11/13/19, 22:31 - Sara: 😔
11/13/19, 22:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm personally always a bit afraid that people think that about me when I ask something from them
11/13/19, 22:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I try my best to show that it's more than that but I don't know if I succeed
11/13/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like asking about photos for example, makes me a bit uneasy
11/13/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, I'm sure that you have plenty of good people around you that treat you well no matter what
11/13/19, 22:36 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/13/19, 22:37 - Sara: I hope and i’m sure
11/13/19, 22:37 - Sara: With Ricardo it has been a question of lack of consideration, he is too independent. But i don’t blame him
11/13/19, 22:38 - Sara: At least I have a perspetive that it would be hard for me to have a relation (of any kind) with a distant person
11/13/19, 22:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't text Thelma so often for example, so when one day I do and I ask about the photos, I'm afraid that she might think that the photos are the only thing I care about
11/13/19, 22:38 - Sara: Well, true
11/13/19, 22:38 - Sara: Little by little
11/13/19, 22:38 - Sara: ~You can ask me about photos :p~
11/13/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I see, so at least it's been a learning experience, and hopefully you will still have a friend, colleague or something like that
11/13/19, 22:39 - Sara: Yes, of course
11/13/19, 22:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already have all your photos ~unless you mean photos of your ass~
11/13/19, 22:40 - Sara: This time has been insane about learning experiences
11/13/19, 22:40 - Sara: ~You have a lot I think haha~
11/13/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, for me too
11/13/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very fast maturation
11/13/19, 22:41 - Sara: This year xddddds
11/13/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Totally worth it
11/13/19, 22:42 - Sara: Yes
11/13/19, 22:42 - Sara: Well
11/13/19, 22:42 - Sara: For me it has been a mixture of everything
11/13/19, 22:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: It would be better if some problems were avoided, obviously
11/13/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But overall, I'm still glad that I went to Ghent, nothing will change that
11/13/19, 22:43 - Sara: Rt
11/13/19, 22:43 - Sara: Me too
11/13/19, 22:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 22:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at least I learned something from these problems so hopefully I won't repeat them
11/13/19, 22:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you have a white tiger hide on your bed? How luxurious xd
11/13/19, 22:45 - Sara: Which ones?
11/13/19, 22:45 - Sara: Like I’m afraid of commeting them again
11/13/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: All of them, I think
11/13/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: No need to
11/13/19, 22:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: What's important for me is that I realize my mistakes and I will do my best to not make them again, no need to go into specifics
11/13/19, 22:46 - Sara: As well
11/13/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: A snobby lion 🦁
11/13/19, 22:47 - Sara: Why snobby?
11/13/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because it wasn't just a regular tiger but a very rare white one
11/13/19, 22:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless it was a ~fake~ soy tiger
11/13/19, 22:49 - Sara: A nazi tiger
11/13/19, 22:49 - Sara: Obviously
11/13/19, 22:49 - Sara: Probably perfect to est
11/13/19, 22:49 - Sara: Eat
11/13/19, 22:49 - Sara: Probably in the same habitat as the soy duck
11/13/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mercadona? Xd
11/13/19, 22:50 - Sara: MERCADONA HHAAHA
11/13/19, 22:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stop, I feel the need to tickle you aaaargh

11/13/19, 23:08 - Sara: I have enough xd
11/13/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: On provided photos I don't see any and my imagination is non existent
11/13/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: So *YES*

11/13/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sleep well and good luck with your exam 🍀
11/13/19, 23:10 - Sara: Hahaha you want to kick my ass out the conversation haha
11/13/19, 23:10 - Sara: Thanks! Good night ^^
11/13/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eee, no, not at all, I'm not going to sleep so if you feel like, I'll be here
11/13/19, 23:11 - Sara: :p
11/13/19, 23:11 - Sara: I know
11/13/19, 23:11 - Sara: I’ll try, I needed
11/13/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I also care about your education and sleep schedule 😂
11/13/19, 23:11 - Sara: I should care about my sleeping hours more often
11/13/19, 23:12 - Sara: Thanks babe 😀
11/13/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, up to you, I'm open to all suggestions
11/13/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I think we will have plenty of time to talk
11/13/19, 23:12 - Sara: Hahaha
11/13/19, 23:12 - Sara: I know ^^
11/13/19, 23:12 - Sara: You can meanwhile listen the songs from the setlist :p
11/13/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I checked some, I don't think they will become my favorite but they are nice and I'm sure that I will enjoy seeing it live
11/13/19, 23:13 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 23:13 - Sara: Mission accomplished
11/13/19, 23:13 - Sara: I’m sure, I promise ^^
11/13/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, no complaints about that from me, that's for sure 💜
11/13/19, 23:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not so cold anymore?
11/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: Haha :P
11/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: Not a bad thing
11/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: I’m still a burrito
11/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: :p
11/13/19, 23:15 - Sara: Buenas noches 💋
11/13/19, 23:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dobranoc, kolorowych snów 🌹
11/13/19, 23:16 - Sara: Dulces sueños misiu :)
11/13/19, 23:18 - Sara: One year ago I went to Warsov 😊🇵🇱❤
11/13/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you expect to ever have any connection to Poland?
11/13/19, 23:20 - Sara: Not at all
11/13/19, 23:20 - Sara: But Idk, i went to this tower and I felt something I haven’t felt before
11/13/19, 23:20 - Sara: Maybe it was a premonition :p
11/13/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: What was it? Maybe it was about your Soviet room?
11/13/19, 23:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/13/19, 23:22 - Sara: Partially similar
11/13/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I know, it was built by the communists and many people don't like it
11/13/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant, what feeling
11/13/19, 23:23 - Sara: Probably
11/13/19, 23:23 - Sara: Mmmm... how to explain it
11/13/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not probably, I know that xd
11/13/19, 23:24 - Sara: I felt overwhelmed probably, I loved the “simple” views of the city at night
11/13/19, 23:24 - Sara: Maybe it was a feeling because of  appreciating what I had or the opportunities because of Erasmus
11/13/19, 23:24 - Sara: It was a really beautiful feeling indeed
11/13/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Warsaw has it's charm, there is a ton of songs about the city
11/13/19, 23:25 - Sara: Sure it is :)
11/13/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I felt similar when I arrived in Ghent, I miss it so much
11/13/19, 23:25 - Sara: Me 2
11/13/19, 23:25 - Sara: The first time in the city at night
11/13/19, 23:26 - Sara: I cried like a baby xd
11/13/19, 23:26 - Sara: Last time*
11/13/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: My first night, I immediately met Italians and went for a beer, it was amazing
11/13/19, 23:27 - Sara: Mine.... idk, i felt secure
11/13/19, 23:27 - Sara: My parents cane with me so the shock was less
11/13/19, 23:27 - Sara: Came*
11/13/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: For it wasn't shocking, it was so exciting, buah, so lovely
11/13/19, 23:28 - Sara: Definitely i agree
11/13/19, 23:28 - Sara: ~but the best was the second semester~
11/13/19, 23:28 - Sara: Time to go to sleep :p
11/13/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed
11/13/19, 23:29 - Sara: In everything
11/13/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also agreed
11/13/19, 23:29 - Sara: People, experiences, feelings
11/13/19, 23:29 - Sara: Good night 😊
11/13/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Good night, darling 🌃
11/13/19, 23:30 - Sara: 🥰🥰🥰
11/14/19, 12:53 - Sara: I answer her
11/14/19, 12:53 - Sara: Here*
11/14/19, 12:54 - Sara: I’m fine! I have to stay at uni and i’m with my friend in the library
11/14/19, 12:54 - Sara: You?
11/14/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Guitar practicing at the moment
11/14/19, 12:55 - Sara: Record something :B
11/14/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hahahaha *~no~*
11/14/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe in a few years xd
11/14/19, 12:58 - Sara: :,(
11/14/19, 12:58 - Sara: Now i’m quite curious of seeing you playing
11/14/19, 12:58 - Sara: Will you play for me in Madrid? 💕
11/14/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I still have 3 weeks to practice but I don't feel any good so it's probably best for both of us if I don't xd
11/14/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Better for your ears 😊
11/14/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But eventually, if I don't lose motivation to practice...
11/14/19, 13:04 - Sara: You heard me sing, it is your time to break my ears xD
11/14/19, 13:04 - Sara: Why lose it
11/14/19, 13:04 - Sara: ?
11/14/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you lose motivation to do things?
11/14/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because it can be difficult, if I start feeling like I'm not getting any better, it also affects motivation a lot
11/14/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I don't feel that way so I hope to succeed
11/14/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, I cannot bring a guitar with me 🎸
11/14/19, 13:07 - Sara: Elisa has a Spanish one in Madrid
11/14/19, 13:07 - Sara: I understand
11/14/19, 13:07 - Sara: But I think music is more than that
11/14/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: And do you play it?
11/14/19, 13:09 - Sara: Guitar? Not really
11/14/19, 13:09 - Sara: It not my thing ~my fingers are too big :c~
11/14/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nonsense, mine are not any smaller
11/14/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Practicing guitar for me is a bit of a weird but also rewarding experience
11/14/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I start trying something, it doesn't work at all and it doesn't even seem possible
11/14/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But then I keep trying and at some point it just starts working
11/14/19, 13:12 - Sara: Big changes come slow :)
11/14/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I get confused, like, how did this happen and why it didn't work before
11/14/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's a pleasant feeling
11/14/19, 13:14 - Sara: It is pleasant to see you improving
11/14/19, 13:14 - Sara: I can tell you but I really suffered since i started singing and playing drums
11/14/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
11/14/19, 13:17 - Sara: I can tell you in a videocall
11/14/19, 13:17 - Sara: But basically insecurities and comparing with others
11/14/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that a proposition?
11/14/19, 13:18 - Sara: Not for now
11/14/19, 13:18 - Sara: But maybe later or in these days
11/14/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I meant later
11/14/19, 13:18 - Sara: For me fine
11/14/19, 13:19 - Sara: Depending on the time I have for doing uni stuff ^^
11/14/19, 13:19 - Sara: But for me it is fine
11/14/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's probably different for you, I don't have any aspirations to play in a band so I don't really feel any pressure
11/14/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool, tell me whenever you want
11/14/19, 13:20 - Sara: Why not? It is the best thing ever
11/14/19, 13:20 - Sara: Nice ^^
11/14/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, first of all, I would need to be actually good at this, also, I don't think I will have time
11/14/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But mainly lack of skill
11/14/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't really feel like something for me, I wanted to play the guitar for myself, nothing else really
11/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: Fair enough
11/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: So many musicians play for themselves
11/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: And that is not bad
11/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: For me, that feeling is huge
11/14/19, 13:24 - Sara: It is about working
11/14/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes, but it takes a long time and I have many other things to learn
11/14/19, 13:28 - Sara: Of course
11/14/19, 13:28 - Sara: It is not your main priorty right?
11/14/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, it's more like a hobby
11/14/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something different, most things I study require just mind, this is different, physical and it's a nice change from time to time
11/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: Yep
11/14/19, 13:50 - Sara: You prefer focus on mind rather than body?
11/14/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, it's just that most things that I need, like languages, programming and that sort of stuff do not require any physical skill
11/14/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I do like to practice physical skills too
11/14/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I used to do it more before, now I guess my priorities shifted
11/14/19, 13:52 - Sara: Damn, I really admire your willingness to do new things
11/14/19, 13:52 - Sara: And to improve them
11/14/19, 13:52 - Sara: Understandable
11/14/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I'm not improving than I'm not moving forward
11/14/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I hate being stuck
11/14/19, 13:55 - Sara: Yes, true
11/14/19, 13:55 - Sara: But you have your goals quite determined
11/14/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I changed my approach in Ghent, I used to be rather ineffective, I picked up new things to learn but I would just study them a lot for a short time and then abandon them
11/14/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm more consistent with my studying, I do it every day but for a shorter time and now I actually see progress
11/14/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I'm more patient now
11/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: That is really great
11/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: Glad Ghent changed that
11/14/19, 13:58 - Sara: I should follow you
11/14/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can start with dancing
11/14/19, 14:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Be patient, consistent and you will definitely see improvement
11/14/19, 14:27 - Sara: I can try later
11/14/19, 14:27 - Sara: Maybe wit studying
11/14/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: With whatever you like, whatever interests you
11/14/19, 15:02 - Sara: Yes
11/14/19, 15:02 - Sara: Idk
11/14/19, 15:02 - Sara: Little by little I guess
11/14/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really understand the whole idea or why you mention me in the comments but ok, if you win something that way, I'm not going to complain xd
11/14/19, 17:16 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAH
11/14/19, 17:16 - Sara: It’s for winning
11/14/19, 17:16 - Sara: And If I win them before december, you can enjoy it as wel :p
11/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: U idiot, always complaining 😂
11/14/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have you ever won something?
11/14/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: How aggressive 😱
11/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: I’d like to xD
11/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: Me? Always
11/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: 🦁
11/14/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you know anybody who ever won something on Instagram?
11/14/19, 17:18 - Sara: These are real accounts, so I trust them
11/14/19, 17:18 - Sara: Any of my people does this, i’m the only weirdo
11/14/19, 17:19 - Sara: Let me be :(
11/14/19, 17:20 - Sara: Sorry if that annoys you
11/14/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't, don't worry
11/14/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm just asking because I don't know anything about instagram
11/14/19, 17:21 - Sara: 😂
11/14/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why, bullying is funny #delatorrism
11/14/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bitch
11/14/19, 17:21 - Sara: HAHAHA so aggresivd
11/14/19, 17:21 - Sara: So direct
11/14/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hija de perra
11/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: Mmmm it is stronger hija de puta
11/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: But that is okay
11/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: Well, in general that is a sexist insult so i don’t like it xd
11/14/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I will use it later
11/14/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't you worry about that xd
11/14/19, 17:23 - Sara: Later when?
11/14/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whenever I feel like of course
11/14/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be a surprise attack
11/14/19, 17:23 - Sara: I’m afraid xd
11/14/19, 17:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing?
11/14/19, 17:24 - Sara: I’m fine! I’m coming back home
11/14/19, 17:24 - Sara: I had already the meeting with my mates and i think the assignment will be fine
11/14/19, 17:24 - Sara: Also we have one more week so i feel relieved
11/14/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you moved it to 18th?
11/14/19, 17:24 - Sara: Later i’ll so to a talk in the sex shop xd
11/14/19, 17:24 - Sara: Yep ^^
11/14/19, 17:25 - Sara: Are you okay?
11/14/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: A talk?
11/14/19, 17:25 - Sara: Mmmm is if not said like that?
11/14/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, I'm fine, nothing unusual
11/14/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know what you mean
11/14/19, 17:25 - Sara: About sex toys, and i’m interested and I felt like
11/14/19, 17:25 - Sara: oh
11/14/19, 17:25 - Sara: People talking about something
11/14/19, 17:26 - Sara: One expert in something talking to people
11/14/19, 17:26 - Sara: Idk the name in English
11/14/19, 17:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, okay, at first I thought of a lecture or something
11/14/19, 17:26 - Sara: I thought it was talk
11/14/19, 17:26 - Sara: Kind of
11/14/19, 17:26 - Sara: More informal haha
11/14/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I guess, I just didn't expect it in the sex shop
11/14/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I was slightly confused
11/14/19, 17:27 - Sara: If I have a sex shop I want it like that
11/14/19, 17:27 - Sara: If is not common but it’s great
11/14/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: And they are not doing it just to try to sell you something during or after?
11/14/19, 17:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: So tired, walking much? xd
11/14/19, 17:30 - Sara: Yes
11/14/19, 17:30 - Sara: Runing to the bathroom xd
11/14/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I see, the talk about sex toys excites you, understandable
11/14/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👌
11/14/19, 17:31 - Sara: I don’t touch myself in the bathroom please
11/14/19, 17:31 - Sara: I have my own bedroom for that xD
11/14/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 17:33 - Sara: 🤔?
11/14/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I love that gif
11/14/19, 17:33 - Sara: Really????? Ohhh i did not know xd
11/14/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/14/19, 17:34 - Sara: I should be one shutting you up but okay xd
11/14/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Equality, bitch
11/14/19, 17:35 - Sara: But it is not the appropriate gif xD
11/14/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not?
11/14/19, 17:35 - Sara: Well... how to explain this xd
11/14/19, 17:36 - Sara: Mmm but maybe it is another way to do oral sex xs
11/14/19, 17:36 - Sara: XD
11/14/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, you are not privileged anymore
11/14/19, 17:37 - Sara: Privileged? Why?
11/14/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: you assumed that only you can do that
11/14/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😈
11/14/19, 17:38 - Sara: It is more common I guess
11/14/19, 17:38 - Sara: If you do it, I die xD
11/14/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Such stereotypical thinking, muy mal
11/14/19, 17:38 - Sara: Why? XD
11/14/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: This obviously 😾
11/14/19, 17:40 - Sara: You have never done iit
11/14/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: *YET*
11/14/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Will there be free testing of sex toys available?
11/14/19, 17:41 - Sara: Did I tell you in the previous talk I tested some?
11/14/19, 17:41 - Sara: Well, not toys
11/14/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, I didn't even know there was a previous one
11/14/19, 17:42 - Sara: I can explain more later ^^
11/14/19, 17:42 - Sara: I think i mentioned in the audio
11/14/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't remember
11/14/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you have time later, I will probably be free
11/14/19, 17:43 - Sara: Nice ^^
11/14/19, 17:43 - Sara: I send it 5 min ago ahhaha
11/14/19, 17:43 - Sara: Too many things to explain haha
11/14/19, 17:44 - Sara: :)
11/14/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, okay, I suppose I didn't interpret as you speaking from experience
11/14/19, 17:45 - Sara: It is okay
11/14/19, 17:45 - Sara: I was too tired for going to the bathroom :s xd

11/15/19, 13:17 - Sara: It was nice
11/15/19, 13:17 - Sara: Xdddd
11/15/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nobody is shooting you yet, so for now seems nice xd
11/15/19, 13:17 - Sara: Xd

11/15/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, true, I remember
11/15/19, 13:18 - Sara: But i’d like to learn and be part of that
11/15/19, 13:19 - Sara: I can schedule myself for some days
11/15/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: What exhibition?

11/15/19, 13:20 - Sara: Well, not when you are here and when i have class haha
11/15/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, seems nice, working for freeee xd
11/15/19, 13:21 - Sara: Do you think is unfair..?
11/15/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I'm kidding
11/15/19, 13:21 - Sara: Should I do it?
11/15/19, 13:21 - Sara: Now you said that
11/15/19, 13:21 - Sara: What is the limit between voluntary work and not wanting to hire people?
11/15/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think that volunteering is bad, just to be clear
11/15/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm actually not sure in this case if it's right
11/15/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's going to be some international conference or something, right?
11/15/19, 13:22 - Sara: Yep
11/15/19, 13:23 - Sara: But it has to be amazing
11/15/19, 13:23 - Sara: Idk
11/15/19, 13:23 - Sara: I have that doubt however
11/15/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Voluntary work for me can only be for some cause that benefits the world, not just some individual, but that's pretty obvious, I guess
11/15/19, 13:24 - Sara: I want only 3 days (formation, being in the street and going there)
11/15/19, 13:24 - Sara: Yes, I guess
11/15/19, 13:24 - Sara: But you can help and being paid 🤔
11/15/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: But sometimes I ask myself if people don't use these ideas to just get free workers
11/15/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, yes, I have some doubts
11/15/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Especially when it's a big event like that
11/15/19, 13:25 - Sara: Idk
11/15/19, 13:25 - Sara: I agree but...
11/15/19, 13:26 - Sara: For learning...
11/15/19, 13:26 - Sara: Idk what to do
11/15/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I know, I have just small doubts, I'm not opposed to the idea and I think that it can be still be quite nice
11/15/19, 13:28 - Sara: Yep
11/15/19, 13:28 - Sara: This is difficult haha
11/15/19, 13:29 - Sara: I’m see
11/15/19, 13:29 - Sara: I’ll
11/15/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You will have the opportunity to confuse people with your spanish accent, you cannot miss it
11/15/19, 13:29 - Sara: :,(
11/15/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌹
11/15/19, 13:30 - Sara: I should improve it
11/15/19, 13:30 - Sara: I guess
11/15/19, 13:30 - Sara: A rose? Haha
11/15/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: It definitely improved since we first met
11/15/19, 13:30 - Sara: Really? Well, i noticed yesterday i have a horrible accent
11/15/19, 13:30 - Sara: XD
11/15/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: When did you notice?
11/15/19, 13:31 - Sara: While talking xD
11/15/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I haven't really noticed any difference between yesterday and all the times before
11/15/19, 13:32 - Sara: I’m complaining all the time about me lmao
11/15/19, 13:32 - Sara: I’ll notice more I guess haha
11/15/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I can understand you without problems, well, aside from the technical issues
11/15/19, 13:34 - Sara: Hahahahahaha

11/15/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems good
11/15/19, 13:43 - Sara: Esara sounds like a digital language
11/15/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to make a distinction, we use that name in Poland too, so for Spain it should be Esara
11/15/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe Espara
11/15/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I'll think about it 🤔
11/15/19, 13:44 - Sara: Oh
11/15/19, 13:44 - Sara: Think what? XD
11/15/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe Assara?
11/15/19, 13:45 - Sara: Saraish is better xd
11/15/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, but that's the language
11/15/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm trying to name its native speakers
11/15/19, 13:48 - Sara: Ohh
11/15/19, 13:48 - Sara: Mmmm

11/15/19, 13:58 - Sara: I wasn’t rude
11/15/19, 13:58 - Sara: Sorry 😔
11/15/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I meant visual proof that you meant "fuck you" romantically rather than as an insult 😋

11/15/19, 14:25 - Sara: ~Maybe more~
11/15/19, 14:25 - Sara: You call me dirty mind but so are you xd
11/15/19, 15:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 15:43 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHA
11/15/19, 15:44 - Sara: Nice hammer
11/15/19, 15:45 - Sara: Actually, those are nice also for massage xD
11/15/19, 15:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Technically it's only for massage, I guess, what you massage specifically is your own choice 😋
11/15/19, 15:46 - Sara: True of course
11/15/19, 15:46 - Sara: I learnt recently that many toys can be used for more than 1 purpose, so that is nice
11/15/19, 15:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 15:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 15:49 - Sara: Acho XDDD
11/15/19, 15:50 - Sara: I think it is in Extremadura, they use Acho for calling someone xd
11/15/19, 15:50 - Sara: Indeed, nice meme
11/15/19, 16:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>

11/15/19, 16:10 - Sara: I did it 😅🤣
11/15/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: How surprising... 🌝
11/15/19, 16:56 - Sara: Xd
11/15/19, 16:56 - Sara: Improving my skills
11/15/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pfff, you replaced skill with technology
11/15/19, 16:57 - Sara: ... yes
11/15/19, 16:58 - Sara: But what orgasms
11/15/19, 16:58 - Sara: Xd
11/15/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough 😋

11/15/19, 18:00 - Sara: In case you haven’t heard it https://youtu.be/r2g0pM3PMNQ
11/15/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is it? Should I know it?
11/15/19, 18:05 - Sara: Nop
11/15/19, 18:05 - Sara: It is a nice Spanish song
11/15/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I heard a song called Flaca but it was different, Argentinian, I think
11/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Really? Mmm no idea
11/15/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Flaca, no me claves, tus puñales, por la espalda, tan profundo, no me duelen, no me hacen mal" 🎶
11/15/19, 18:07 - Sara: I haven’t heard it
11/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: It is a different one
11/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Hahaha
11/15/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I noticed xd
11/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Por un beso de la flaca daria lo que fuera. Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera :p
11/15/19, 18:08 - Sara: Xd
11/15/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCF9oHXhDMU

11/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: The one i send you is ~mode danceable~ better
11/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: Hahaha
11/15/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: This one seems a bit sad
11/15/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Aren't you busy?
11/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: Yep
11/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: Waiting in the queue
11/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: El prado is quite visited
11/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: Idk if taking you here
11/15/19, 18:12 - Sara: But it is one of the best museums
11/15/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: We'll see, if we have time, why not, otherwise, there are probably more interesting things to do
11/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: Yep ^^
11/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: I have other things in mind, other museums as well
11/15/19, 18:13 - Sara: You should check when you have time :p
11/15/19, 18:14 - Sara: I was also seeing if on friday we can go somewhere, checking the festivity day schedule
11/15/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: The day I arrive?
11/15/19, 18:16 - Sara: Nop
11/15/19, 18:16 - Sara: The day after
11/15/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I arrive on friday
11/15/19, 18:17 - Sara: Oh okay okay true
11/15/19, 18:17 - Sara: My mind xdddd
11/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: On saturday xd
11/15/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, probably you are distracted ~by sex, like always~ by the queue or something xd
11/15/19, 18:19 - Sara: ~ Please, i don’t want you here only for sex~ probably, too long i have to think about random stuff
11/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: That didn't quite work, did it? Xd
11/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But me neither, it's quite low on the priority list
11/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I will joke about it anyway
11/15/19, 18:20 - Sara: Which is the priority? Hahaha
11/15/19, 18:21 - Sara: I know 💗
11/15/19, 18:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just meeting in person, I guess
11/15/19, 18:21 - Sara: :)
11/15/19, 18:21 - Sara: I agree
11/15/19, 18:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 18:22 - Sara: 🤗
11/15/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe not the best one, you crushing me, and me clinging for life ❤️
11/15/19, 18:38 - Sara: You love my huggs
11/15/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very much, stronger than expected
11/15/19, 19:38 - Sara: Yes
11/15/19, 19:38 - Sara: But i’m from castilla la mancha
11/15/19, 19:39 - Sara: It’s in my genes
11/15/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Region of Esaraña is known for strong huggers, I've heard about it
11/15/19, 21:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing?
11/15/19, 22:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/15/19, 22:10 - Sara: You ok?

11/15/19, 22:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: To talk
11/15/19, 22:22 - Sara: If you don’t have it is okay ^^
11/15/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: When do you want to talk?
11/15/19, 22:23 - Sara: Time i mean
11/15/19, 22:23 - Sara: Just a suggestion, whenever you want if you want
11/15/19, 22:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I don't mind
11/15/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now I'm curious what do you want to ask me about 🤔
11/15/19, 22:25 - Sara: I can comment it here
11/15/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, but if you want to talk, we can do that as well
11/15/19, 22:26 - Sara: You seem busy, do not worry
11/15/19, 22:26 - Sara: I don’t want to annoy xd
11/15/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, actually, I'm not
11/15/19, 22:27 - Sara: Sure?
11/15/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/15/19, 22:28 - Sara: Okay
11/15/19, 22:28 - Sara: Wait a second
11/15/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at the moment, maybe just text, call, maybe around 11, is that fine?
11/15/19, 22:29 - Sara: Okaaay
11/15/19, 22:29 - Sara: I will do some stuff
11/15/19, 22:29 - Sara: I will comment it, i promise :p
11/15/19, 22:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ask your question 🙋
11/15/19, 22:30 - Sara: Now?
11/15/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I mean if you want
11/15/19, 22:32 - Sara: Later if you don’t mind
11/15/19, 22:32 - Sara: When I call you
11/15/19, 22:32 - Sara: It is not important or problematic don’t worry haha
11/15/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: How was the exhibition?
11/15/19, 22:34 - Sara: I comment it in the video call sorry
11/15/19, 22:34 - Sara: I’m getting a little bit anxious
11/15/19, 22:34 - Sara: I call you around 11
11/15/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, sorry, sure no problem
11/16/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 01:04 - Sara: I wrote you for you not being worried about this
11/16/19, 01:05 - Sara: I think it is about how much I feel exposed in these kinds of situations.
11/16/19, 01:06 - Sara: It is hard to read others, and I don’ want neither of us being uncomfortable
11/16/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if it's about that, but if you don't need to feel embarrassed for anything
11/16/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't stop because it was uncomfortable but because I actually don't have a good place for it in the house right now
11/16/19, 01:07 - Sara: I don’t know, giving a sexual step with you is harder, because it is not only about sex
11/16/19, 01:07 - Sara: I know I know
11/16/19, 01:07 - Sara: But I should have stopped I guess
11/16/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if it helps you in any way, I didn't consider anything that just happened embarrassing
11/16/19, 01:08 - Sara: Partially It is also seeing me for observing how you see me
11/16/19, 01:08 - Sara: Because it didn’t happen I guess
11/16/19, 01:08 - Sara: I’m so sorry, and you have told me you didn’t like these kind of situations
11/16/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you did something more, I also wouldn't have any problems with that, seriously, it's fine
11/16/19, 01:09 - Sara: I feel like walking in ice with you in this situation
11/16/19, 01:09 - Sara: I don’t want to fuck it up in anyway
11/16/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like that all the time now tbh, everything just seems so fragile and easy to break
11/16/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you're not alone in this
11/16/19, 01:10 - Sara: I’ll avoid this, so sorry
11/16/19, 01:10 - Sara: I feel stupid af
11/16/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But avoid what exactly?
11/16/19, 01:11 - Sara: This more sexual situations
11/16/19, 01:12 - Sara: I saw you a bit uncomfortable, it is fine
11/16/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as I said, I don't really have any problem with it other than the fact that I'm in my parents house
11/16/19, 01:12 - Sara: I know
11/16/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mostly because I don't want to talk about this with my family now
11/16/19, 01:13 - Sara: Understandable
11/16/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's true that it was a bit difficult to relax, but not because of you
11/16/19, 01:13 - Sara: I guess I understand that talking about me is weird
11/16/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe if the situation stabilizes, right now, I don't see the point, I don't even know what I would say
11/16/19, 01:15 - Sara: Okay, I don’t want you to be uncomfortable
11/16/19, 01:15 - Sara: In that case I need to say you something
11/16/19, 01:16 - Sara: In case you don’t want to them to see it, but check your mail soon
11/16/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't get me wrong, I'm not ashamed of you
11/16/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just that I would rather tell them about it when it is clear
11/16/19, 01:17 - Sara: I think it is time to go to sleep xdd
11/16/19, 01:17 - Sara: Understandable
11/16/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because now it's kind of hard to explain
11/16/19, 01:18 - Sara: I know
11/16/19, 01:18 - Sara: I’m sorry
11/16/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which mail?
11/16/19, 01:19 - Sara: Well... postbox
11/16/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, actual mail? Not email?
11/16/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh
11/16/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Plot twist
11/16/19, 01:19 - Sara: Xd
11/16/19, 01:20 - Sara: It was a secret but in case you want to avoid the conversation about me
11/16/19, 01:20 - Sara: Good night
11/16/19, 01:20 - Sara: See you tomorrow
11/16/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think my mother suspects it anyway and again, I'm not ashamed of you
11/16/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: When did you send it?
11/16/19, 01:21 - Sara: Today
11/16/19, 01:21 - Sara: Sorry, really
11/16/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why sorry?
11/16/19, 01:22 - Sara: I should go to sleep
11/16/19, 01:22 - Sara: Really
11/16/19, 01:22 - Sara: I prefer being calmed
11/16/19, 01:22 - Sara: Good night 🌙
11/16/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'm sorry too, I didn't want to make you anxious or sad 😔
11/16/19, 01:23 - Sara: Don’t worry
11/16/19, 01:23 - Sara: I’m okay
11/16/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, love you, good night ♥️
11/16/19, 01:24 - Sara: Sorry for being a mess
11/16/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Remember that if you need to talk, I'm here for you
11/16/19, 09:04 - Sara: Thanks <3
11/16/19, 09:04 - Sara: Love you too
11/16/19, 09:04 - Sara: Just forget it 😅 Sometimes I act without conciousness
11/16/19, 12:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, if you say so, don't worry about it
11/16/19, 12:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
11/16/19, 12:13 - Sara: I’m fine
11/16/19, 12:13 - Sara: Waiting for the bus in Madrid
11/16/19, 12:13 - Sara: You?
11/16/19, 12:13 - Sara: I just feel vulnerable in many senses
11/16/19, 12:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
11/16/19, 12:14 - Sara: Insecurities about body, mind and about what will happen about us
11/16/19, 12:14 - Sara: So it is a feeling of “oh shit, in any moment I can fuck everything up”
11/16/19, 12:15 - Sara: Maybe it is this period, sorry
11/16/19, 12:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't feel like yesterday fucked anything up, so at least about that, you don't need to worry
11/16/19, 12:17 - Sara: Okay, everything must be in my mind I guess
11/16/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least in front of me, you don't need to be insecure about your body and mind either
11/16/19, 12:17 - Sara: Thanks ^^
11/16/19, 12:17 - Sara: Maybe it is the situation
11/16/19, 12:18 - Sara: Can I control that?
11/16/19, 12:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Difficult to say, probably it will take time
11/16/19, 12:19 - Sara: Yes..:
11/16/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~And compliments~
11/16/19, 12:19 - Sara: Sorry, really
11/16/19, 12:19 - Sara: I’m not comfortable with myself and i think people will see me like that as well
11/16/19, 12:19 - Sara: Xd
11/16/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I can only try to convince you that I don't see you that way then
11/16/19, 12:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll try 😘
11/16/19, 12:20 - Sara: And i should be responsible of that
11/16/19, 12:20 - Sara: Haha thanks
11/16/19, 12:20 - Sara: You don’t need to
11/16/19, 12:21 - Sara: :)
11/16/19, 12:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know but I want to
11/16/19, 12:23 - Sara: Thanks :)
11/16/19, 12:23 - Sara: Are you okay?
11/16/19, 12:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, a little bit tired, but okay
11/16/19, 12:25 - Sara: When did you wake up? Did you sleep well?

11/16/19, 12:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, an hour ago, more or less

11/16/19, 12:30 - Sara: 🥰🥰🥰
11/16/19, 12:30 - Sara: Maybe it is about getting less asleep :p
11/16/19, 12:31 - Sara: You get easily impressed with big eyes, not used to them?
11/16/19, 12:31 - Sara: 👀
11/16/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I simply do like them very much, deal with it 😼

11/16/19, 12:46 - Sara: Hahahahaha
11/16/19, 12:46 - Sara: I remember we commented something during the sexual questionnaires
11/16/19, 12:47 - Sara: About ~mirrors in the ceiling~ using cameras and photograph the other
11/16/19, 12:47 - Sara: It has to be funny
11/16/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as long as they don't end up on the internet, sounds like fun xd
11/16/19, 12:48 - Sara: I’m not that evil
11/16/19, 12:48 - Sara: You can trust me
11/16/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

11/16/19, 12:50 - Sara: Really will you stop ticking me?! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
11/16/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to comment about boobs because if by now you don't believe that Iike them then I don't know what else to say 😂
11/16/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stop thinking right now, and resume in Spain 😋

11/16/19, 12:51 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/16/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I'll try not to think about it but when I arrive in Spain I most definitely will
11/16/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember licking it a lot, everything seems bigger from that kind of distance 😂❤️
11/16/19, 12:53 - Sara: I’ll try to convince you not to make me suffer xd
11/16/19, 12:53 - Sara: Lick my belly? Or other things? XD
11/16/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, everything really, but here, specifically the belly
11/16/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😛
11/16/19, 12:54 - Sara: I don’t remember you explicitly licking my belly
11/16/19, 12:54 - Sara: I imagine it and sounds weird haha
11/16/19, 12:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean, most of the time I started around the neck (so lovely, btw 💋) and then proceeded lower and lower
11/16/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, kissing, licking, that sort of thing
11/16/19, 12:57 - Sara: 🥰
11/16/19, 12:57 - Sara: In that case, yes
11/16/19, 12:57 - Sara: In that moment you don’t know what is big or not
11/16/19, 12:57 - Sara: At least in me xd
11/16/19, 12:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like your body, deal with that, bitch #delatorrism
11/16/19, 12:58 - Sara: Thanks
11/16/19, 12:58 - Sara: I should see it in another way
11/16/19, 12:59 - Sara: Idk why this issue is really affecting me
11/16/19, 13:00 - Sara: When body is the least important thing in the universe
11/16/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it is quite important to feel well in your own body, so I wouldn't diminish it like that, personally
11/16/19, 13:01 - Sara: But focusing your self-esteem because of you body...
11/16/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, that no
11/16/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I personally think that it is quite important to work on our bodies to improve them
11/16/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really for others to see
11/16/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But to improve health, both physical and mental
11/16/19, 13:02 - Sara: I cannot work it on :/
11/16/19, 13:02 - Sara: I agree, it is really nice doing exercise
11/16/19, 13:03 - Sara: I miss it
11/16/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a few more days, don't worry about it
11/16/19, 13:03 - Sara: I hope
11/16/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure of it 💪
11/16/19, 13:04 - Sara: :)
11/16/19, 13:04 - Sara: Thanks
11/16/19, 13:04 - Sara: I hope I can change something xd
11/16/19, 13:04 - Sara: Idk why i’m so negative
11/16/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Piensa pensamientos positivos 😊
11/16/19, 13:07 - Sara: I try
11/16/19, 13:07 - Sara: Maybe i’m a bit lost in life
11/16/19, 13:07 - Sara: Ugh
11/16/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, I am the negative one in this relation, don't you dare steal my position
11/16/19, 13:08 - Sara: You? Negative?
11/16/19, 13:08 - Sara: You changed a lot
11/16/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since when?
11/16/19, 13:09 - Sara: Idk but you know what you want and you are working for getting it
11/16/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, this is something that you can do too, anybody can, if they just want to
11/16/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can discuss that, if you want to
11/16/19, 13:11 - Sara: Maybe when we have more time
11/16/19, 13:11 - Sara: It is fine
11/16/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although, it's probably a conversation for a call
11/16/19, 13:11 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/16/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, I would prefer to talk about that rather than texting
11/16/19, 13:12 - Sara: Yeah me too
11/16/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so, whenever you have time, I'm here for you
11/16/19, 13:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe almost whenever
11/16/19, 13:13 - Sara: Thanks
11/16/19, 13:13 - Sara: I have it in mind
11/16/19, 13:13 - Sara: But you don’t need to be here always, i need to deal with this as well alone
11/16/19, 13:13 - Sara: I don’t like others taking responsability of my shit
11/16/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: In my current situation I simply have plenty of time to talk with you, I like talking with you and I like helping people so here you have it
11/16/19, 13:15 - Sara: Thanks :)
11/16/19, 13:15 - Sara: Sure I don’t annoy you always like this?
11/16/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
11/16/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌹
11/16/19, 13:16 - Sara: :)
11/16/19, 13:16 - Sara: In my mind, i assume people (will) dislike me for being sad or vulnerable
11/16/19, 13:16 - Sara: I’m not like this
11/16/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you feel like I dislike you?
11/16/19, 13:17 - Sara: No
11/16/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I believe that nobody is like that
11/16/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: People simply go through hard time from time to time
11/16/19, 13:17 - Sara: But maybe you get tired of me and my behaviour
11/16/19, 13:18 - Sara: You and others
11/16/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: And when that hard time comes it's nice to have someone to support you
11/16/19, 13:18 - Sara: I’m silly I know xD
11/16/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: So, no, I don't have any problem with that
11/16/19, 13:19 - Sara: Of course :)
11/16/19, 13:19 - Sara: Okay
11/16/19, 13:19 - Sara: Thankss

11/16/19, 16:12 - Sara: Mmmmm i remove it from time to time
11/16/19, 16:12 - Sara: I’m still opposed i Guess
11/16/19, 16:12 - Sara: I don’t like being insulted or mocked by that xd
11/16/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough
11/16/19, 16:13 - Sara: Hahahaha
11/16/19, 16:13 - Sara: What are you doing?
11/16/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just finished with the car so now I'll probably study a bit
11/16/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next weekend I will most likely go to the geothermal pools
11/16/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I also talked with my mother about going to Wrocław to the Christmas market
11/16/19, 16:14 - Sara: that is nicee
11/16/19, 16:14 - Sara: When?
11/16/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: So maybe it will work
11/16/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shortly before going to Spain
11/16/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know exact days yet
11/16/19, 16:15 - Sara: That is nice
11/16/19, 16:15 - Sara: Have fun in advance ^^
11/16/19, 16:16 - Sara: Weird that your parents go as well
11/16/19, 16:16 - Sara: But that’s good
11/16/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Today you're probably going to be busy in the evening, right?
11/16/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why weird?
11/16/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at the beginning I planned to go by myself, maybe with my brother but they shown some interest so why not, I don't have any problem with that
11/16/19, 16:17 - Sara: You told me your parents don’t like trips or moving
11/16/19, 16:17 - Sara: Depending on the hour, why?
11/16/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing in particular, just talk if you have time
11/16/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes, it is quite unusual
11/16/19, 16:18 - Sara: I can see later

11/16/19, 16:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, time and if you want
11/16/19, 16:20 - Sara: Why is it like that?
11/16/19, 16:20 - Sara: I understand ^^
11/16/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because most of the time is spent on trying to figure out how to do something or why something doesn't work
11/16/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Doesn't look like in the movies at all xd
11/16/19, 16:21 - Sara: Hahahaha

11/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: Probably not
11/16/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in any case, that's why it was a bit surprising
11/16/19, 16:40 - Sara: I don’t have any problem
11/16/19, 16:41 - Sara: But hate guys commenting
11/16/19, 16:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at the same time, with that kind of photos it's probably unavoidable
11/16/19, 16:41 - Sara: Guys should respect
11/16/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want my comments 😋
11/16/19, 16:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed
11/16/19, 16:42 - Sara: Yes, because I know that you are not sexualising me
11/16/19, 16:43 - Sara: And I consented it :P
11/16/19, 16:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: That reminds me, I should send you the consent document, just in case, if we meet in the court, I'll be covered

11/16/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I only wish that it was also fluffy like that rabbit 😢
11/16/19, 17:12 - Sara: Is it not? :(
11/16/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your fur is not so nice 😂
11/16/19, 17:15 - Sara: Why? :,(

11/16/19, 17:25 - Sara: Xddd
11/16/19, 17:25 - Sara: Why rape
11/16/19, 17:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anything not included in the contract and script will be considered rape, it's a clause in the contract
11/16/19, 17:26 - Sara: Yes I know
11/16/19, 17:26 - Sara: ~joking about rape is not my thing~
11/16/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, sorry
11/16/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes my #delatorrism is too strong
11/16/19, 17:27 - Sara: Thanks for understanding it
11/16/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I forget myself sometimes
11/16/19, 17:28 - Sara: Sometimes idk how to express something is not my piece of cake
11/16/19, 17:29 - Sara: I know that you do it without hurting, but i wouldn’t like to even joke about me raping anyone
11/16/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I never treated it seriously but I remember that you were a bit concerned about it after Patrick Foley, sorry, I should know better
11/16/19, 17:30 - Sara: It is okay
11/16/19, 17:30 - Sara: Like if that really happened I would like to know it
11/16/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, it didn't
11/16/19, 17:30 - Sara: Okay

11/16/19, 17:50 - Sara: :(((((((((((
11/16/19, 17:50 - Sara: I'm so bad at saying good-byes, u know

11/16/19, 17:51 - Sara: ❤
11/16/19, 17:51 - Sara: I hope everything goes fine and i could do to Poland :)
11/16/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, it would be best if I move out of my parents house first
11/16/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I imagine that if you visit it's probably going to be in summer maybe, no?
11/16/19, 17:52 - Sara: Probably
11/16/19, 17:53 - Sara: I know that after exams i have a free week

11/16/19, 17:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, we'll see, even if I won't move out by then, renting some room or apartment in Poland for a few days is not particularly expensive
11/16/19, 17:55 - Sara: Xd
11/16/19, 17:55 - Sara: Nothing in poland is expensive xd
11/16/19, 17:56 - Sara: :p

11/16/19, 18:03 - Sara: 🤔 hate deciding
11/16/19, 18:03 - Sara: xD
11/16/19, 18:04 - Sara: I'm thinking that there is a cool palace in Segovia, but it closed on mondays
11/16/19, 18:04 - Sara: As well as some museums in Toledo about arabic culture, which should be quite interesting for you to see it
11/16/19, 18:06 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 18:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 18:08 - Sara: I like Arabic shit, deal with it haha
11/16/19, 18:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's called Stockholm syndrome
11/16/19, 18:09 - Sara: HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA DAMN
11/16/19, 18:09 - Sara: So bad
11/16/19, 18:09 - Sara: In fact, I have been here and ❤
11/16/19, 18:10 - Sara: I'll think but ummmmmm
11/16/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: looks nice, so whatever we do, should be fine
11/16/19, 18:11 - Sara: I'll ask for advice to my parents XDDDD
11/16/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: probably the longest HAHAAH to date, new record 💪
11/16/19, 18:12 - Sara: Because I didn't expect it
11/16/19, 18:12 - Sara: Maybe you can check what you like the most
11/16/19, 18:12 - Sara: It is true that I haven't been here, as far as I remember
11/16/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: ok, so that would be nice to visit then
11/16/19, 18:13 - Sara: I'll still thinking :P
11/16/19, 18:27 - Sara: I have recorded myself dancing xdddd
11/16/19, 18:27 - Sara: And... it is not extremely bad x)
11/16/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure it's not bad at all ❤
11/16/19, 18:29 - Sara: It is a very sexy song and damce so maybe i’m not 100% in the mood haha
11/16/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: do you need inspiration?
11/16/19, 18:31 - Sara: ~Maybe when I perform it in front of you will be different~ well...
11/16/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: so you're not going to show me the video? 😢
11/16/19, 18:33 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/16/19, 18:34 - Sara: And some parts are still like meh
11/16/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Big-eyed potato bambi 🥰
11/16/19, 18:35 - Sara: :3
11/16/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everybody always wants to show only the end result but I think that the steps that had to be taken to reach that result are equally as interesting
11/16/19, 18:36 - Sara: Why? They are worse?
11/16/19, 18:36 - Sara: !
11/16/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I like to see the progression, then the end result is even more impressive
11/16/19, 18:37 - Sara: I don’t know if continuing this choreography further
11/16/19, 18:37 - Sara: But yep, i can send it to you
11/16/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: up to you, I really respect anybody's effort to get better at something
11/16/19, 18:38 - Sara: ^^
11/16/19, 18:38 - Sara: I’m afraid of failure xd
11/16/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you think I would laugh or ridicule any attempts at self improvement than you don't know me very well
11/16/19, 18:40 - Sara: I know you won’t laugh or anything
11/16/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: From my perspective, the only failure is not trying
11/16/19, 18:40 - Sara: That explains my whole life xd
11/16/19, 18:41 - Sara: Xd
11/16/19, 18:41 - Sara: I share your view
11/16/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: then why are you afraid?
11/16/19, 18:41 - Sara: Xd
11/16/19, 18:41 - Sara: Feeling ridiculous
11/16/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: you practice alone and I already told you that
11/16/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: but I obviously won't force you to show me anything
11/16/19, 18:43 - Sara: Thanks :)
11/16/19, 18:43 - Sara: Sorry xd
11/16/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: why sorry?
11/16/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy that you are working on something you like, that's all I need to know
11/16/19, 18:44 - Sara: Not even that xd
11/16/19, 18:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: what do you mean?
11/16/19, 18:45 - Sara: I don’t normally dance now
11/16/19, 18:45 - Sara: Today because I have time I tried again
11/16/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously you have other, more important things to occupy your time but that's not a failure
11/16/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: when you have time, you practice, it's not like you have to do it every day
11/16/19, 18:47 - Sara: I guess
11/16/19, 18:47 - Sara: What shitty days gosh xd
11/16/19, 18:48 - Sara: I’m really sorry you have to deal with me like this xd
11/16/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I tolerated you only when you are at your best I would be a shitty friend (or something)
11/16/19, 18:49 - Sara: True
11/16/19, 18:49 - Sara: But you don’t deserve wasting you time xdd
11/16/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: what makes you think I'm wasting it?
11/16/19, 18:50 - Sara: Idk i’m always sad and negative
11/16/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Life difficulties rarely last just a few days
11/16/19, 18:51 - Sara: Uhh xd
11/16/19, 18:51 - Sara: I wish
11/16/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Point is, I understand that it takes time to get better and I'm a liitle bit offended that you think I would abandon you, or any friend, because they are sad
11/16/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that friendship is tested in the hard times, not the good times
11/16/19, 18:53 - Sara: I know
11/16/19, 18:53 - Sara: And that is really nice
11/16/19, 18:54 - Sara: Thanks
11/16/19, 18:54 - Sara: Maybe I force myself to do things I cannot do
11/16/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: like what?
11/16/19, 18:55 - Sara: Dancing, studying other things, playing better my instruments xd
11/16/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: are these things something that you like and really want?
11/16/19, 18:55 - Sara: I guess
11/16/19, 18:55 - Sara: I don’t know
11/16/19, 18:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: what makes you happy?
11/16/19, 18:57 - Sara: Can we talk later? I don’t feel like talking about that
11/16/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure, no problem
11/16/19, 18:57 - Sara: Thanks
11/16/19, 18:57 - Sara: Have a nice evening
11/16/19, 18:57 - Sara: 🤗
11/16/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: You too, sweetheart 💋
11/16/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: and love yourself a bit more
11/16/19, 18:58 - Sara: Really difficult 😂
11/16/19, 18:58 - Sara: But i’ll try
11/16/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just take my example, go to the mirror and say "Hmm Sara, you have very nice, big eyes and very fuckable eyebrows 👉😉👉"
11/16/19, 19:05 - Sara: :)
11/16/19, 19:05 - Sara: But it not only my physical appearance
11/16/19, 19:05 - Sara: It is everything
11/16/19, 19:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but it's something to start with
11/16/19, 19:06 - Sara: I will try
11/16/19, 19:06 - Sara: I looked today at the mirror and meh xd
11/16/19, 19:06 - Sara: Again, I ate a lot xdd

11/18/19, 12:32 - Sara: Why you google it xd
11/18/19, 12:32 - Sara: Culazo could mean like big ass, but also that it is a really nice one 😊
11/18/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to be sure xd

11/18/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kind of on the topic xd
11/18/19, 13:24 - Sara: That is definitely you haha
11/18/19, 13:24 - Sara: But it is understandable :p
11/18/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's really a shame that there is no brown heart emoji
11/18/19, 13:27 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA i can’t xd
11/18/19, 13:28 - Sara: ~but having sex with the period is better~
11/18/19, 13:28 - Sara: 💩 kind of
11/18/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 13:31 - Sara: Damn xd
11/18/19, 13:31 - Sara: Mmmm but i have a dilemma
11/18/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: About what?
11/18/19, 14:21 - Sara: XD
11/18/19, 14:22 - Sara: About this girl’s tendency to like “raw” sex
11/18/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Raw? Xd
11/18/19, 14:22 - Sara: HAHAHAH
11/18/19, 14:23 - Sara: Well, you know
11/18/19, 14:23 - Sara: Like being submissive
11/18/19, 14:23 - Sara: Oh
11/18/19, 14:24 - Sara: I have seen that it means sex without condon HAHHAA
11/18/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm not judging xd
11/18/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I knew that meaning 😂
11/18/19, 14:24 - Sara: xddd
11/18/19, 14:24 - Sara: I know, but it is something that it is in my mind recently
11/18/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: In what sense?
11/18/19, 14:25 - Sara: In the sense of why girls like normally being mistreated during sex xd
11/18/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you?
11/18/19, 14:28 - Sara: I don’t know
11/18/19, 14:28 - Sara: I try to avoid it
11/18/19, 14:28 - Sara: It scares me
11/18/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess it depends how you define it
11/18/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Technically, being pushed against the wall could be slightly mistreating
11/18/19, 14:30 - Sara: I know that they are with a person they trust, those things can be *consented*
11/18/19, 14:31 - Sara: But in men-woman sex idk to what extend those roles of domination/submission are prolongued
11/18/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess depends on individual person, some men also like to be dominated so for me, as long as everything is consented, I don't have any problem
11/18/19, 14:32 - Sara: Mmmmm idk it is a interesting topic
11/18/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the reason itself for liking that kind of play is quite interesting
11/18/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know, I don't really have much interest in this kind of fetish so hard for me to say
11/18/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Slightly rough can be exciting sometimes but at least for me, nothing really mistreating
11/18/19, 15:02 - Sara: Like what? 🌝
11/18/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like you need to ask 🌚
11/18/19, 15:03 - Sara: Society c:
11/18/19, 15:03 - Sara: I want to explicitly know it
11/18/19, 15:03 - Sara: :B
11/18/19, 15:04 - Sara: For the consent contract of course
11/18/19, 15:04 - Sara: Only business purposes
11/18/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 15:05 - Sara: Oh boy 🌚
11/18/19, 15:05 - Sara: Only 2 weeks ♥
11/18/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is a week in Spain 8 days?
11/18/19, 15:06 - Sara: Yes
11/18/19, 15:06 - Sara: Used for siesta
11/18/19, 15:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, understandable
11/18/19, 15:10 - Sara: ~One day for you to stay~
11/18/19, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Stay whole day in bed?~
11/18/19, 15:19 - Sara: ~sex marathon?~
11/18/19, 15:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Sleep marathon?~
11/18/19, 15:24 - Sara: Yes please
11/18/19, 15:24 - Sara: 😴 💕
11/18/19, 15:24 - Sara: :B
11/18/19, 15:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You see, I know exactly what you need, I'm a sarientist
11/18/19, 15:57 - Sara: What I need, doctor?
11/18/19, 15:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sleeeeeep ❤️
11/18/19, 15:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Was your doctor appointment today? I can't remember
11/18/19, 15:59 - Sara: Yes, I’m waiting ^^
11/18/19, 15:59 - Sara: No sex? :(
11/18/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe you can have both at the same time 🤔
11/18/19, 16:01 - Sara: Doctor, that is rape xd
11/18/19, 16:01 - Sara: But one after the other is fine 👌🏻
11/18/19, 16:01 - Sara: Would you be the one administering it?
11/18/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, trust me, I'm a sarientist
11/18/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless it's in the contract 😄
11/18/19, 16:02 - Sara: Excellent, doctor 👨‍⚕
11/18/19, 16:02 - Sara: :D
11/18/19, 16:03 - Sara: When do you want to sign it?
11/18/19, 16:03 - Sara: What is the function of a sarientist?
11/18/19, 16:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a Sara scientist, I think it's pretty self explanatory
11/18/19, 16:03 - Sara: I know :P
11/18/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sort of like zoologist I guess
11/18/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Observe the behavior in the natural environment, study it
11/18/19, 16:04 - Sara: Scientist who study bitches?
11/18/19, 16:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I'm looking for connections, similar behaviors, that sort of thing
11/18/19, 16:05 - Sara: Excellent
11/18/19, 16:05 - Sara: Be aware of wild Saras
11/18/19, 16:05 - Sara: They bite
11/18/19, 16:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, this bitch is named Gaya but considering her behavior, probably Sara would be more fitting
11/18/19, 16:07 - Sara: Naming her Sara? Not bad 😎
11/18/19, 16:07 - Sara: So original...
11/18/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll try, but she's a bitch so she might not like it
11/18/19, 16:07 - Sara: Name exchange probably
11/18/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, fuck off with your shitty Jewish name #delatorrism
11/18/19, 16:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🌹
11/18/19, 16:10 - Sara: You are supoosed to care about jewish :(
11/18/19, 16:10 - Sara: I don’t know the meaning you want to give to the rose
11/18/19, 16:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, meaning of a rose depends on its color
11/18/19, 16:13 - Sara: Red?
11/18/19, 16:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, this color is commonly known as red
11/18/19, 16:15 - Sara: Ha ha
11/18/19, 16:15 - Sara: But i don’t still get the idea xd
11/18/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what's the idea behind sending ♥?
11/18/19, 16:16 - Sara: Well
11/18/19, 16:16 - Sara: It’s love
11/18/19, 16:16 - Sara: But a rose...
11/18/19, 16:16 - Sara: I like roses
11/18/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, a red rose, what kind of meaning can it have
11/18/19, 16:19 - Sara: That I have thorns? :p
11/18/19, 16:19 - Sara: Eternal love and purity
11/18/19, 16:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Basically I use it as an equivalent of ♥ to mix things up a little, come on
11/18/19, 16:21 - Sara: Oh
11/18/19, 16:21 - Sara: Good to know ♥
11/18/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, if I gave you a rose in real life, how would you interpret it?
11/18/19, 16:22 - Sara: Like 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
11/18/19, 16:22 - Sara: And then i’d faint
11/18/19, 16:22 - Sara: I love flowers
11/18/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, another information for the Book of Sara 🌹

11/18/19, 16:34 - Sara: I have infection xd
11/18/19, 16:34 - Sara: But a very simple one
11/18/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a virus called Sars you know...
11/18/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Close enough I guess
11/18/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: But seriously, it's at least good that it's nothing bad 😊
11/18/19, 16:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, so you will survive...

11/18/19, 17:28 - Sara: And without drinking alcohol xd
11/18/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fortunately by the time I arrive you should be healthy so no te preocupes, podremos tomar mucho
11/18/19, 17:32 - Sara: Aw

11/18/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 18:15 - Sara: Cálida :)
11/18/19, 18:15 - Sara: En España hace más calor 🌞
11/18/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mentira 🤥
11/18/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Por lo menos no ahora mismo
11/18/19, 18:19 - Sara: En mi cama si 🌚
11/18/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dentro un burrito? Supongo que sí 🌯
11/18/19, 18:25 - Sara: Yay
11/18/19, 18:25 - Sara: Me puedes comer si quieres
11/18/19, 18:25 - Sara: Pero soy picante 🌶
11/18/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Burrito picante y mojado? No sé pero soy curioso 🤔
11/18/19, 18:31 - Sara: Yo diría “tengo curiosidad”
11/18/19, 18:31 - Sara: Dame un bocado :B
11/18/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 18:34 - Sara: Perfect 👍
11/18/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope you're not overly attached to your nose 😉
11/18/19, 18:41 - Sara: Do I have to say goodbye? :(
11/18/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can visit it sometimes, wherever I'm going to live in the future
11/18/19, 18:43 - Sara: I hope you like Madrid 🤩
11/18/19, 18:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: The question is will Madrid like me?
11/18/19, 18:46 - Sara: You’ll find out :)
11/18/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't count in december xd
11/18/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a more serious note, I was actually thinking about Barcelona
11/18/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can find a job there, I think it could be quite nice
11/18/19, 18:49 - Sara: Mmmmmm
11/18/19, 18:49 - Sara: Veeery expensive
11/18/19, 18:49 - Sara: But cool city
11/18/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Madrid is less expensive?
11/18/19, 18:49 - Sara: Yes, a bit less
11/18/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Define 'a bit'
11/18/19, 18:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said 'thank you' to someone in Spain? What are you, some filthy turist?
11/18/19, 18:54 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you don't want to teach me Spanish pronunciation, thanks Sara, I'll remember that 😔
11/18/19, 18:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, I'm glad that you don't teach me, terrible accent, terrible pronunciation, terrible everything, you should stay with the sign language #delatorrism
11/18/19, 18:58 - Sara: 👉🏻👌🏻?
11/18/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🖖👅
11/18/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👆🍑?
11/18/19, 19:00 - Sara: 💩?
11/18/19, 19:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😷👍
11/18/19, 19:00 - Sara: HAHAHAH
11/18/19, 19:00 - Sara: You suggested it 🤔
11/18/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👉😉👉
11/18/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Should I take some supplies with me from home? 🤔
11/18/19, 21:06 - Sara: What is happening haahha
11/18/19, 21:06 - Sara: Supplies? 🤔
11/18/19, 22:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 22:09 - Sara: Xd
11/18/19, 22:09 - Sara: Please
11/18/19, 22:10 - Sara: And about the piercings
11/18/19, 22:10 - Sara: I appreciate what you have just said
11/18/19, 22:10 - Sara: But you seem concerned if I have one
11/18/19, 22:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, I probably overthink it, sorry
11/18/19, 22:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really dislike the lip one
11/18/19, 22:11 - Sara: It is okay
11/18/19, 22:11 - Sara: Don’t worry
11/18/19, 22:11 - Sara: Don’t judge me if I have one or not
11/18/19, 22:11 - Sara: It is my choice
11/18/19, 22:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I told you so
11/18/19, 22:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: We discussed it briefly, I'll never mention it again, that's all, sorry
11/18/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still a bit lost on the reasons though, you said that the difference is that you would be wearing it 24/7 but what is stopping you from doing that with the one you have already?
11/18/19, 22:24 - Sara: No no
11/18/19, 22:24 - Sara: We can discuss this topic ^^
11/18/19, 22:25 - Sara: I just thought that you haven’t though about me, but about your opinion about them
11/18/19, 22:25 - Sara: I don’t know, i just want to have them
11/18/19, 22:25 - Sara: If I find them in a store and i can remove it and put it as i wish, i’d buy them
11/18/19, 22:25 - Sara: But there isn’t any bad wearing them
11/18/19, 22:26 - Sara: Your conception about me would change? That would worry me
11/18/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, of course not
11/18/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: The lip one concerns me because of kissing, I don't know if other types would be getting in the way as well, or not
11/18/19, 22:27 - Sara: Again, you are thinking about yoursef
11/18/19, 22:27 - Sara: And if people wear them, you can kiss
11/18/19, 22:27 - Sara: If that is what worries you
11/18/19, 22:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry, I don't think anything can change my mind and I don't want to make you feel like I'm trying to force you to something, it's a stupid thing to argue about
11/18/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry about all of this
11/18/19, 22:28 - Sara: Don’t worry
11/18/19, 22:28 - Sara: Just I want to make sure you respect my decisions
11/18/19, 22:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't have to like them but of course I respect them
11/18/19, 22:28 - Sara: I felt like “oh piercings, that would be a problem for me to have something/respect her”
11/18/19, 22:29 - Sara: That I know it is not about that
11/18/19, 22:29 - Sara: But I have never seen a reaction like that
11/18/19, 22:29 - Sara: I’d not be like that
11/18/19, 22:30 - Sara: Or at least i’d say it in other ways
11/18/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: The only thing is that I think you look better without them, nothing else, nothing more, it's not really important, sorry again, I don't know what happened to me
11/18/19, 22:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: It doesn't make you less respectable in any sense
11/18/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm feeling pretty stupid for arguing about this, I'm sorry, forget that I ever mentioned it
11/18/19, 22:36 - Sara: Kamil
11/18/19, 22:36 - Sara: Don’t feel that
11/18/19, 22:36 - Sara: You can tell me whatever you want 💕
11/18/19, 22:36 - Sara: I’d to know what came to your mind
11/18/19, 22:38 - Sara: But be aware of the way you say it
11/18/19, 22:44 - Sara: Especially you know that i’m trying to improve my physical appearance, so for me this is “important”
11/18/19, 22:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you asked for opinions and mine is that it's not an improvement at all but I should've ended at that, the rest was really stupid and unnecessary, sorry
11/18/19, 22:46 - Sara: Sweetheart
11/18/19, 22:46 - Sara: Don’t push yourself
11/18/19, 22:46 - Sara: It is okay
11/18/19, 22:47 - Sara: Just be aware of the manners
11/18/19, 22:47 - Sara: If you are not always like that it is okay, i trust you
11/18/19, 22:48 - Sara: But please, be aware
11/18/19, 22:49 - Sara: If I were a more insecure girl and even if i want one, i wouldn’t do it
11/18/19, 22:50 - Sara: I love you a lot, that is why i tell you this
11/18/19, 22:50 - Sara: And I know you
11/18/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I love you too, can we end this topic? Preferably forever?
11/18/19, 22:52 - Sara: Okay
11/18/19, 22:52 - Sara: But don’t feel bad
11/18/19, 22:52 - Sara: I’m not sad or angry

11/18/19, 23:02 - Sara: Apart from the doctor, I met a friend and we had a walk
11/18/19, 23:02 - Sara: Are you okay? What did you do?
11/18/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I went to uni and then just some stuff at home but I didn't feel very productive
11/18/19, 23:04 - Sara: Why?
11/18/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: idk, just not my best day I guess
11/18/19, 23:04 - Sara: Do you need to talk?
11/18/19, 23:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>

11/18/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's actually pretty similar
11/18/19, 23:42 - Sara: This one is yours, right?
11/18/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: More true than you imagine, I actually really like singing that song
11/18/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: When I'm alone, of course
11/18/19, 23:43 - Sara: Not with me? :(
11/18/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's hard enough with myself, with others, impossible
11/18/19, 23:43 - Sara: I could help :P
11/18/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, if I could leave the room when I'm singing, I would
11/18/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: And leave the singing in the room, of course
11/18/19, 23:44 - Sara: No, I want to see you singing ❤
11/18/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you like to suffer?

11/18/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm discovering the language of gods
11/18/19, 23:51 - Sara: Why of gods?
11/18/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's kind of like hieroglyphs or something
11/18/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure that a few hundred years from now some archeologist will find it
11/18/19, 23:52 - Sara: I hope they find this

11/19/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

11/19/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Enhorabuena 👏
11/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: Well...
11/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: I tried to masturbate this afternoon without the satisfyer and... i fell asleep
11/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: So not a master xd
11/19/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
11/19/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not funny

11/19/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Must have looked nice, Sara asleep with a hand in her panties 😽
11/19/19, 00:10 - Sara: Basically xd
11/19/19, 00:10 - Sara: I’m afraid of being used too much to sex toys
11/19/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I mentioned something like this when you bought it
11/19/19, 00:11 - Sara: But it won’t happen I guess
11/19/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: That later anything else might be a bit dissapointing
11/19/19, 00:11 - Sara: Sex disappointing?
11/19/19, 00:11 - Sara: Wtf Kamil
11/19/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know, I don't use any toys
11/19/19, 00:12 - Sara: Not interested?
11/19/19, 00:12 - Sara: Feeling the other person is 10000 times better even if I don’t have the orgasm
11/19/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe after I move out, but I don't know, I never really thought about it
11/19/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wanted to say that
11/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: Toys will never replace anybody
11/19/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I told you that I'm not afraid of that
11/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: I know
11/19/19, 00:14 - Sara: And they can be really funny is they are used with others
11/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: But they do replace regular masturbation, it seems, which is not bad
11/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Agreed
11/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: Yesss
11/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: Idk it is different
11/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: And you explore sexuality
11/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: It is nice
11/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: You love more my satisfyer than me haha
11/19/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, you haven't introduced me yet
11/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: You’ll meet her
11/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: Don’t worry 💕
11/19/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll take her and run away together, somewhere far
11/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: Again, replacing
11/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: Not new Kamilo
11/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: :,(
11/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this was fully justified
11/19/19, 00:17 - Sara: You are on your way to find the bitchiest one
11/19/19, 00:17 - Sara: I’m not enough :,(

11/19/19, 00:20 - Sara: My kinkiest dream

11/19/19, 00:25 - Sara: Is not her?
11/19/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: The other one
11/19/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bitch prefers head scratches
11/19/19, 00:25 - Sara: Can I still prove i’m a bitch?
11/19/19, 00:25 - Sara: As well
11/19/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can try
11/19/19, 00:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: And with that you proved what exactly?
11/19/19, 00:27 - Sara: I don’t know
11/19/19, 00:27 - Sara: Lick? Xd
11/19/19, 00:28 - Sara: ~I’m better proving in bed~
11/19/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you don't like doggy style so you'll never be a true bitch
11/19/19, 00:28 - Sara: Sad but true
11/19/19, 00:28 - Sara: Well... there is always a pussy
11/19/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you can't purr either 😢
11/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: :,(
11/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: What am I then?!?! 😭😭😭
11/19/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: What kind of position is pussy style? xd
11/19/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish, sadly
11/19/19, 00:30 - Sara: Mmmmm.....
11/19/19, 00:30 - Sara: Sad
11/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know it actually, it was something that I wanted to try at the very beginning but I wasn't sure how to do it exactly
11/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: (I'm still not sure)
11/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: In February I mean
11/19/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Apparently this is quite good if done right
11/19/19, 00:33 - Sara: We can try ^^
11/19/19, 00:33 - Sara: Too nervious for this goddess?
11/19/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, also, but I'm not quite sure how to do it properly, it's a different type of movement than usually
11/19/19, 00:34 - Sara: I think I know how it works
11/19/19, 00:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, please
11/19/19, 00:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Substitute the salad with donuts and it will probably work
11/19/19, 00:36 - Sara: Oh mamma
11/19/19, 00:36 - Sara: Yes
11/19/19, 00:36 - Sara: Sara style then
11/19/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that how vegans date? Like, you leave the salad on the floor to attract someone and when some vegan is busy eating you fuck them from behind?
11/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: Obviously
11/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: We need a trap
11/19/19, 00:37 - Sara: Nobody wants to fuck vegans
11/19/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, I mean who would like to fuck a cow, that would be weird
11/19/19, 00:38 - Sara: 🐮 💕
11/19/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it can also be called Andraž style xd

11/19/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that digital penetration?
11/19/19, 00:43 - Sara: Why screwed it up?
11/19/19, 00:43 - Sara: I can solve it ^^
11/19/19, 00:44 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not screwed it up, screwed up

11/19/19, 21:24 - Sara: You had girlfriend 🤗
11/19/19, 21:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess so, I just didn't know it yet
11/19/19, 21:25 - Sara: In that moment, we were a couple right?
11/19/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, actually yes
11/19/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about the night I puked in the shower
11/19/19, 21:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I kind of slept on the floor xd
11/19/19, 21:26 - Sara: Oh
11/19/19, 21:26 - Sara: Well... both did I think
11/19/19, 21:26 - Sara: But then I could move you to the bed I think
11/19/19, 21:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I didn't do it myself, I was loyal to my non existent girlfriend 😋
11/19/19, 21:28 - Sara: True

11/19/19, 21:50 - Sara: You have already a job :B
11/19/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you were taller you could wear me like a backpack while I would be doing my job
11/19/19, 22:43 - Sara: Heels?
11/19/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I don't think it's enough, they just make the legs longer
11/19/19, 22:56 - Sara: But i’d be taller than you
11/19/19, 22:56 - Sara: :B
11/19/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not in bed
11/19/19, 22:57 - Sara: Sex with heels? 🤔
11/19/19, 22:58 - Sara: I have checked you have been a good holder :p
11/19/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe makes sense for recording 🤔
11/19/19, 22:59 - Sara: Interested? 🤔
11/19/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really know how tbh, unless just some parts, otherwise it would be very long xd
11/19/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know, maybe just to see how it even looks
11/19/19, 23:00 - Sara: 2h xd
11/19/19, 23:00 - Sara: I’m curious but scared at the same time about that
11/19/19, 23:04 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: it's kind of off topic but I like this song and it kind of describes my view of you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDlOD1Hw9k
11/19/19, 23:05 - Sara: I’ll listen to it :p
11/19/19, 23:05 - Sara: Ay
11/19/19, 23:05 - Sara: Like the title :p
11/19/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You've never heard it?
11/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: Yes
11/19/19, 23:06 - Sara: But never paid attention to lyrics
11/19/19, 23:08 - Sara: But yep, I'm too harsh with myself
11/19/19, 23:08 - Sara: Thanks babe ❤
11/19/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: it has your eyes ❤
11/19/19, 23:14 - Sara: This is about you :p https://youtu.be/uMK0prafzw0
11/19/19, 23:15 - Sara: Dark eyes yay
11/19/19, 23:15 - Sara: 💋
11/19/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing?
11/19/19, 23:17 - Sara: I’m good, just reading a bit for uni
11/19/19, 23:17 - Sara: You okay? :)
11/19/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/19/19, 23:17 - Sara: What have you been doing today?
11/19/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing particularly interesting, just studying, practicing and working a bit on the thesis
11/19/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
11/19/19, 23:18 - Sara: Is it going good?
11/19/19, 23:19 - Sara: Went to class, came back home, did uni stuff, i masturbated because “why not?” and watched the drag queen program with my sister
11/19/19, 23:19 - Sara: Xd
11/19/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite detailed description xd
11/19/19, 23:20 - Sara: 👌🏻
11/19/19, 23:20 - Sara: ~as you were here~
11/19/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~I'm in the future~
11/19/19, 23:21 - Sara: Yay
11/19/19, 23:21 - Sara: And also I had like a weird feeling towards Guada, i don’t know how to interpret it
11/19/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dime más
11/19/19, 23:22 - Sara: It was a sense of irrational dependence, weird af
11/19/19, 23:22 - Sara: Like I think I have been so used to it that something I have certain impulses or thoughts and then it is like ???
11/19/19, 23:23 - Sara: Not romantic or sexual
11/19/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: How is that situation btw? Any better than the last time we talked about it?
11/19/19, 23:23 - Sara: With him? I think it is better, yes
11/19/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: 7 years, I imagine
11/19/19, 23:24 - Sara: I'm glad he wants to do the effort to come to Toledo on Friday on purpose to see me
11/19/19, 23:24 - Sara: It is fine, at least we are talking
11/19/19, 23:24 - Sara: And well, I hope in person, the relationship improves
11/19/19, 23:24 - Sara: Both of us had time to think
11/19/19, 23:25 - Sara: + 2 knowing each other before xd
11/19/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Off topic, but it's a bit stupid that English doesn't have a way to distinguish romantic and other relations, it's always just "relationship", in polish we have different words for this and in spanish I think there is also a distinction
11/19/19, 23:27 - Sara: mmmm in Spanish we can say relación de amistad or just amistad
11/19/19, 23:27 - Sara: but if we say relación, we assume it is a love relationship
11/19/19, 23:27 - Sara: Paying attention to what I was saying hahahahha xd
11/19/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just something that I was thinking about before
11/19/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: And this reminded me
11/19/19, 23:27 - Sara: Don't worry hahaha
11/19/19, 23:28 - Sara: and which words do you have?
11/19/19, 23:28 - Sara: :)
11/19/19, 23:28 - Sara: That reminds me that I really love when you talk Polish :P
11/19/19, 23:29 - Sara: It is funny seeing you in messenger when any family membe of yours comes and talks with you
11/19/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: For a love relationship we can say 'związek', for friendship 'przyjaźń' or just more generic to use for anything 'znajomość'
11/19/19, 23:30 - Sara: dwfegretewfe
11/19/19, 23:30 - Sara: hahahah sorry
11/19/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course you have to conjugate these xd
11/19/19, 23:30 - Sara: how? xD
11/19/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Polish has 7 cases, so a lot
11/19/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish and English don't have that
11/19/19, 23:31 - Sara: But in terms of gender, number...?
11/19/19, 23:31 - Sara: or MAGIC?
11/19/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's complex so I would just say MAGIC https://mowicpopolsku.com/polish-grammar/cases/
11/19/19, 23:32 - Sara: Similar to Latin I guess????
11/19/19, 23:32 - Sara: I haven't learned Latin but reminds  me to that
11/19/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: no clue, I know that german also has this, although far simpler
11/19/19, 23:33 - Sara: Like not the cases themselves but the way the language is developed
11/19/19, 23:33 - Sara: And German is almost Latin 😎
11/19/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: close enough
11/19/19, 23:33 - Sara: hope you are listening more to rammstein btw xD
11/19/19, 23:34 - Sara: btw, a song about your fav series by one of my fav groups❤ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MmXK42sCB0
11/19/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not favorite anymore
11/19/19, 23:35 - Sara: I know XD
11/19/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: still hurts 😢
11/19/19, 23:35 - Sara: really? hahahaha c'mone
11/19/19, 23:36 - Sara: There is a GoT exhibition, maybe we can go :P
11/19/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Season 8 is like a ruined orgasm
11/19/19, 23:36 - Sara: HAHAHAHA RUINED ORGASM
11/19/19, 23:36 - Sara: how do you feel it? XD
11/19/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dissapointing, to the deepest parts of my soul
11/19/19, 23:37 - Sara: is that what you really feel? xD
11/19/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: about Game of Thrones? YES
11/19/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will never watch it again
11/19/19, 23:38 - Sara: about ruined orgasms xd
11/19/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, they feel like Game of Thrones so I guess xd
11/19/19, 23:38 - Sara: Never have sex again xd
11/19/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: nah, Game of Thrones is much worse
11/19/19, 23:39 - Sara: hahahah
11/19/19, 23:39 - Sara: really so disappointed? XD
11/19/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although if I would be waiting eight years for an orgasm and then, at the very end it would be ruined then perhaps I would never want sex again xd
11/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: pffff hahaha
11/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: damn girl
11/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: you mail it
11/19/19, 23:41 - Sara: nail*
11/19/19, 23:42 - Sara: I won’t disappoint you
11/19/19, 23:42 - Sara: I swear
11/19/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will add that to the contract, I think there was a part called 'Failure to perform'
11/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: How would be added exactly?
11/19/19, 23:45 - Sara: Impress me
11/19/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will have to think of some sort of compensation in case of underperformance (like fallling asleep por ejemplo)
11/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Of be wrong with the hole
11/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: 🕳
11/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Makes senses
11/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Perfecto Kamil
11/19/19, 23:47 - Sara: Muy bien
11/19/19, 23:48 - Sara: Oh I found a solution
11/19/19, 23:48 - Sara: Stripteases 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
11/19/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:49 - Sara: Holy shit xd
11/19/19, 23:49 - Sara: Literally xd
11/19/19, 23:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:51 - Sara: Xddd
11/19/19, 23:51 - Sara: It has to hurt
11/19/19, 23:51 - Sara: Please don’t do that hahaha
11/19/19, 23:52 - Sara: But the difference is huge
11/19/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: between what?
11/19/19, 23:52 - Sara: The two holes xd
11/19/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, just to be safe, I suppose you should always lube your ass
11/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: I thought you were doing it for me
11/19/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: minimize the damage
11/19/19, 23:54 - Sara: Chasing me...
11/19/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, I can, no problem and it's going to have a nice, strawberry scent
11/19/19, 23:55 - Sara: Perfect to eat, right Kamilo?
11/19/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: Xxdd
11/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: Nah, more seriously
11/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: You said you were interested in anal sex right?
11/19/19, 23:57 - Sara: Like for me it is indifferent
11/19/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know and don't really care too much, if you wish to try it, I guess we can, if not, also fine
11/19/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought that you were more interested than me?
11/19/19, 23:59 - Sara: Mmmm
11/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: I’m interested in new things
11/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: But for anal sex I need time and more trust I think
11/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: With Guada I suggested it in the last year so imagine
11/20/19, 00:00 - Sara: It requires a loooot of time so...
11/20/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, I for sure won't push for that, so entirely up to you
11/20/19, 00:01 - Sara: Yes but
11/20/19, 00:01 - Sara: It is about two xD
11/20/19, 00:01 - Sara: Not everything depends on me haha
11/20/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, but in this case it demands a lot more from you than from me
11/20/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: so, for me, if you want fine, if not, also fine
11/20/19, 00:02 - Sara: In which sense? That I need more preparation?
11/20/19, 00:02 - Sara: Okay hahaha
11/20/19, 00:03 - Sara: ~mirrors on the ceiling?~
11/20/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, obviously, and it's unlikely that it would hurt me in any way
11/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: As well
11/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: First we need physical space xddd
11/20/19, 00:04 - Sara: And then time :p
11/20/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I will joke about it anyway 🍆🍑
11/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: I think i’ll go to sleep
11/20/19, 00:08 - Sara: ~i wish not only jokes 💦 ~
11/20/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Up ~your ass~ to you
11/20/19, 00:09 - Sara: Anything else to ~try~ say?
11/20/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍆🍈🍈?
11/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: You told me you didn’t like it
11/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: 🤔
11/20/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't even remember ever doing it
11/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: Hhahaha i tried once
11/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: You always say the same haha
11/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: But i have it in mind
11/20/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Even if we did, it was probably without proper lubrication 🤔
11/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: ~bring the lub~
11/20/19, 00:12 - Sara: Although i’d like to buy ~a real~ another one
11/20/19, 00:16 - Sara: Dobranoc 💋
11/20/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buona notte bella ❤️

11/20/19, 17:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always told you that english is shit, polish is the superior form of communication
11/20/19, 17:06 - Sara: Language exchange when you come :p

11/20/19, 18:43 - Sara: common in Japan i think
11/20/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: A good reason to never go there then
11/20/19, 18:45 - Sara: Visit should be fine
11/20/19, 18:45 - Sara: Not living there
11/20/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 20:10 - Sara: Well
11/20/19, 20:10 - Sara: Maybe I have developed this skill
11/20/19, 20:10 - Sara: And you don’t know it
11/20/19, 20:10 - Sara: As my milk
11/20/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should release some sort of document with all the recent updates and changes, something like 'Sara, version 1.2 change log'
11/20/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: *version 6.9 sorry, I made a typo
11/20/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or is it already version 9.11? I don't know at this point tbh
11/20/19, 20:55 - Sara: Mmmmm
11/20/19, 20:55 - Sara: You have it
11/20/19, 20:55 - Sara: Which one is it? :p
11/20/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I know that recently you updated from version 2.0 to 2.1 but I don't know if you had any further updates
11/20/19, 21:07 - Sara: Mmmmm
11/20/19, 21:07 - Sara: Maybe i’m 3 :p
11/20/19, 21:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope that you will be 3 in december
11/20/19, 22:24 - Sara: Yay
11/20/19, 22:24 - Sara: Let’s see
11/20/19, 22:24 - Sara: Everything good?
11/20/19, 22:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, you?
11/20/19, 23:50 - Sara: Yep
11/20/19, 23:50 - Sara: We went to a woman comedy show
11/20/19, 23:51 - Sara: It was really nice
11/20/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: 'Woman comedy' HAHAHAHA
11/20/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Accept it, you're not funny 😘
11/21/19, 00:09 - Sara: We are clowns
11/21/19, 00:09 - Sara: For dating guys
11/21/19, 00:09 - Sara: 🤡
11/21/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, but it doesn't mean you're funny
11/21/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😋
11/21/19, 00:10 - Sara: I thought it was a reason to laigh c:
11/21/19, 00:11 - Sara: And clowns are made for others to laugh
11/21/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or to eat children
11/21/19, 00:11 - Sara: My parents
11/21/19, 00:11 - Sara: Please
11/21/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that way, I really like them
11/21/19, 00:11 - Sara: When you can eat them?
11/21/19, 00:11 - Sara: You also like women for that
11/21/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your parents are clowns?
11/21/19, 00:12 - Sara: Yes
11/21/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: How rude, I'm calling Paco right now
11/21/19, 00:12 - Sara: To bring me to life
11/21/19, 00:12 - Sara: Please
11/21/19, 00:13 - Sara: I want to see that conversation
11/21/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, everything has its uses
11/21/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Paco, no hablo español pero tu hija de perra me dijo que tú eres un payaso,¿es verdad?"
11/21/19, 00:14 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/21/19, 00:14 - Sara: TU HIJA DE PERRA JAJA
11/21/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did I do well? I think he understood, he will contact you soon
11/21/19, 00:16 - Sara: Paco will understand
11/21/19, 00:16 - Sara: Do not worry haha
11/21/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Genial ♥️
11/21/19, 00:16 - Sara: You are a great person
11/21/19, 00:16 - Sara: You are helping me to achieve my dream
11/21/19, 00:17 - Sara: Dying 🌟 💫
11/21/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: De nada, cielo 💋
11/21/19, 00:17 - Sara: Xddd
11/21/19, 00:17 - Sara: Kamil, are your jokes really jokes?
11/21/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, ask your father
11/21/19, 00:18 - Sara: Whut haha
11/21/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know how Paco interpreted our little chat
11/21/19, 00:18 - Sara: Xddd
11/21/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't know right now
11/21/19, 00:19 - Sara: I didn’t mean that
11/21/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Entonces, que quieres decir?
11/21/19, 00:19 - Sara: This
11/21/19, 00:20 - Sara: Maybe I overthink a lot about this
11/21/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you really think I would judge it based on gender?
11/21/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would need to see it first, maybe it was funny, maybe not, how should I know 😊
11/21/19, 00:21 - Sara: Just asking
11/21/19, 00:21 - Sara: I know, I guess
11/21/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you knew me better than that
11/21/19, 00:21 - Sara: I know you
11/21/19, 00:21 - Sara: I know you joke
11/21/19, 00:22 - Sara: But i think jokes hides some truth
11/21/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I secretly hate women?
11/21/19, 00:22 - Sara: I hope not 😂
11/21/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think being funny has anything to do with gender
11/21/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Well, maybe just one~
11/21/19, 00:24 - Sara: Mmmmm what do you mean?
11/21/19, 00:24 - Sara: The least xd
11/21/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anybody can be funny or unfunny and the possession or lack of penis doesn't have influence on that
11/21/19, 00:27 - Sara: Oh
11/21/19, 00:27 - Sara: Okay
11/21/19, 00:27 - Sara: I know haha
11/21/19, 00:27 - Sara: Maybe that wasn’t my point
11/21/19, 00:27 - Sara: But maybe I overthink a lot
11/21/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
11/21/19, 00:28 - Sara: “A lot”
11/21/19, 00:28 - Sara: Just afraid of, with jokes, people being oppressing
11/21/19, 00:29 - Sara: That you really think what you are “joking” about
11/21/19, 00:29 - Sara: You or somebody else
11/21/19, 00:29 - Sara: Maybe specially men but
11/21/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Secret misogyny, seriously? I wouldn't expect you to think that of me
11/21/19, 00:30 - Sara: Noooo
11/21/19, 00:30 - Sara: Well idk
11/21/19, 00:30 - Sara: Again
11/21/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, up to you
11/21/19, 00:32 - Sara: Maybe i’m overreacting
11/21/19, 00:32 - Sara: But i don’t have good experiences with jokes
11/21/19, 00:32 - Sara: Sorry 🙁
11/21/19, 00:32 - Sara: I don’t want you to be angry ><
11/21/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said it yourself before, you don't want people to think of you things that are not true, me neither
11/21/19, 00:34 - Sara: Maybe it is i’m not used to jokes, probably
11/21/19, 00:36 - Sara: Well, no need to discuss that
11/21/19, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 00:42 - Sara: That is surprising
11/21/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which gun do you have? Basques prefer bombs so they don't have that many guns, but Castilla la  stain seems particularly aggressive
11/21/19, 00:46 - Sara: Can we talk tomorrow?
11/21/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you alright?
11/21/19, 00:46 - Sara: Not that much but it is okay
11/21/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you sure? I have time
11/21/19, 00:47 - Sara: Not in the mood, also useless
11/21/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's never useless
11/21/19, 00:48 - Sara: And maybe it is better for me to go to sleep, that tomorrow it is a long day
11/21/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to push, remember, if you need me, I'm here
11/21/19, 00:49 - Sara: Instead of understanding me, you felt attacked from the first moment. You made me feel i’m exaggerated when i’m on the right to feel bad about this jokes
11/21/19, 00:50 - Sara: But I prefer to go to sleep
11/21/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Look at it from my perspective, you implied some pretty heavy things to me
11/21/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: That hurts
11/21/19, 00:51 - Sara: Why hurts?
11/21/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: To think that it might be what you think of me, obviously feels bad
11/21/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's one thing to say that a joke was inapropriate, another to insinuate something like that
11/21/19, 00:53 - Sara: I told you i don’t normally like this kind of jokes
11/21/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that's fine, I'm sorry for that
11/21/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this is not fine
11/21/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or this
11/21/19, 00:55 - Sara: My experience, I gues
11/21/19, 00:55 - Sara: Guess
11/21/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really thought you knew me better
11/21/19, 00:56 - Sara: I know you
11/21/19, 00:56 - Sara: Sorry if I disapponted you
11/21/19, 00:57 - Sara: I can say the same but you don’t deserve this kind of comment
11/21/19, 00:58 - Sara: Just... i don’t know
11/21/19, 00:58 - Sara: I should definitely go to sleep
11/21/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not angry at you, just be careful with these kind of comments, they can hurt a lot
11/21/19, 00:58 - Sara: Okay
11/21/19, 00:59 - Sara: But don’t make me feel i’m crazy for not liking these jokes
11/21/19, 00:59 - Sara: Please, take my words seriously
11/21/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I reacted to your comments, not to the fact that you didn't like them, I made that joke before and it was fine so I didn't expect that it would hurt you, sorry
11/21/19, 01:01 - Sara: Okay
11/21/19, 01:01 - Sara: Also depends a lot about the mood
11/21/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something happened? I thought you were okay after the show?
11/21/19, 01:03 - Sara: No
11/21/19, 01:04 - Sara: I was okay after the show
11/21/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, sorry for screwing it up
11/21/19, 01:06 - Sara: Well, this is a complex topic
11/21/19, 01:06 - Sara: Sorry for screwing it up
11/21/19, 01:07 - Sara: I think I just need to be a burrito and go to sleep
11/21/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, talk to you tomorrow then?
11/21/19, 01:07 - Sara: I suppose
11/21/19, 01:07 - Sara: If i’m not dying
11/21/19, 01:07 - Sara: Long day
11/21/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, good luck then, I'm not going to bother you anymore now
11/21/19, 01:08 - Sara: You don’t bother me
11/21/19, 01:09 - Sara: I’m in a moment of i don’t know what is wrong or right
11/21/19, 01:09 - Sara: Or doing always the same thing of retaining my emotions for not making others feel guilty about something
11/21/19, 01:10 - Sara: I’m not exagerating about what i feel, but i’m feeling that
11/21/19, 01:10 - Sara: Sorry if I said you could be sexist or these kind of adjectives
11/21/19, 01:10 - Sara: But after people that were my friends insulting me all the time for my hair or for being feminists by “jokes”, i really feel bad
11/21/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can tell me that I fucked up, it wasn't funny and I should stop, no problem with that at all
11/21/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: But this is hurtful, considering what we have
11/21/19, 01:11 - Sara: What we have exactly?
11/21/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not sure tbh
11/21/19, 01:11 - Sara: I’m still knowing you
11/21/19, 01:12 - Sara: And that is a long-life process
11/21/19, 01:12 - Sara: For me at least, with all the people
11/21/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: For sure, I agree
11/21/19, 01:13 - Sara: Just fears I guess
11/21/19, 01:13 - Sara: And i have never liked jokes in most of the cases
11/21/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Goodnight
11/21/19, 01:15 - Sara: Sorry for all of this
11/21/19, 01:15 - Sara: Good night
11/21/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not your fault, I made a mistake too
11/21/19, 01:16 - Sara: But i don’t want you to feel bad
11/21/19, 01:16 - Sara: To be mad at me
11/21/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not mad at you
11/21/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't want you to feel bad either
11/21/19, 01:17 - Sara: I’m try
11/21/19, 01:17 - Sara: All the bad things are forgotten when we sleep
11/21/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: *sleep together
11/21/19, 01:18 - Sara: I’ll*
11/21/19, 01:18 - Sara: I wish
11/21/19, 01:18 - Sara: Don’t hate me
11/21/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't, you should know that
11/21/19, 01:19 - Sara: I have my things, what I like and what I don’t like, my insecurities
11/21/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: 2 weeks left 💋
11/21/19, 01:19 - Sara: I’m trying to do my best
11/21/19, 01:19 - Sara: And I feel i’m screwing everything up
11/21/19, 01:19 - Sara: With tiny little things
11/21/19, 01:19 - Sara: Even if I know that something bothers me and I don’t like it
11/21/19, 01:20 - Sara: I’m delicate, i’m in a delicate situation and ugh
11/21/19, 01:20 - Sara: Fear of not being understood or doing things bad
11/21/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You won't get rid of me so easily so don't worry, ~still hate you the least~ I don't hate you at all
11/21/19, 01:21 - Sara: 😭
11/21/19, 01:22 - Sara: Maybe it is lack of understanding? I don’t know
11/21/19, 01:22 - Sara: I’m stressed
11/21/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why? Tell me
11/21/19, 01:23 - Sara: Tomorrow I have to do a lot of stuff and i want to get up soon, so I won’t slep that much
11/21/19, 01:23 - Sara: And also this
11/21/19, 01:23 - Sara: I don’t know what is going on and that makes me anxious and being frightened
11/21/19, 01:24 - Sara: I’m a disaster
11/21/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in simplest words, I hope that you are still someone to love for me and that I am still someone to love for you, it hasn't really changed for me
11/21/19, 01:25 - Sara: Let’s see in two weeks
11/21/19, 01:26 - Sara: You are on time to run away from me 😂
11/21/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: What makes you think I want to run away?
11/21/19, 01:27 - Sara: My breakdowns, my moments of truth (sometimes, being rude)
11/21/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Again, you won't get rid of me so easily
11/21/19, 01:27 - Sara: ~Probably people don’t see me as I see myself~
11/21/19, 01:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't give up on you, you don't give up on me
11/21/19, 01:29 - Sara: Thanks for the support
11/21/19, 01:29 - Sara: Do it because you want to, not as an obligation
11/21/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where did you get the idea that I consider this an obligation?
11/21/19, 01:31 - Sara: Maybe I read the message in a different way
11/21/19, 01:31 - Sara: Maybe I should go to sleep
11/21/19, 01:31 - Sara: My head will explode soon
11/21/19, 01:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for everything, goodnight sweetie 💋
11/21/19, 01:32 - Sara: Sorry for everything as well
11/21/19, 01:33 - Sara: Good night and have a good day
11/21/19, 01:33 - Sara: 🤗
11/21/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
11/21/19, 10:34 - Sara: Hey
11/21/19, 10:34 - Sara: I could be better
11/21/19, 10:34 - Sara: I should sleep more
11/21/19, 10:35 - Sara: But these days are going to be busy af and i’m a little bit stressed
11/21/19, 10:35 - Sara: You?
11/21/19, 10:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok, nothing new on my side
11/21/19, 10:36 - Sara: Thesis nice?
11/21/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I won't interfere then, good luck
11/21/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, seems ok
11/21/19, 10:37 - Sara: I’ll try to find a moment to answer
11/21/19, 10:37 - Sara: Do not worry
11/21/19, 10:37 - Sara: Maybe in the haidressers’
11/21/19, 10:37 - Sara: Xd
11/21/19, 10:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not necessary, you should focus on more important things
11/21/19, 10:38 - Sara: They are important
11/21/19, 10:38 - Sara: But it doesn’t mean you are not
11/21/19, 10:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I said 'more important'
11/21/19, 10:40 - Sara: Don’t feel set aside
11/21/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't, considering that you have a lot of work to do, I would advise you myself to set me aside, I can wait, uni can not
11/21/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: So don't worry about that
11/21/19, 10:42 - Sara: I don’t want you to feel bad or feel aside
11/21/19, 10:42 - Sara: I’ll try to find some time
11/21/19, 10:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why would I feel bad about you having a lot of work to do?
11/21/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will express my discontent to your professors when I arrive xd
11/21/19, 10:44 - Sara: For me not having life as well :(
11/21/19, 10:44 - Sara: Please
11/21/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will mention this too xd
11/21/19, 10:45 - Sara: xddddd
11/21/19, 10:45 - Sara: Talk to you later, i should focus in the class :P
11/21/19, 10:45 - Sara: 😘
11/21/19, 10:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nos vemos 💋
11/21/19, 10:46 - Sara: :)
11/21/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: "Profesor de mierda, ¿por qué hija de Paco tiene que trabajo tan mucho? No tiene tiempo para hacer nada más y no me gusta eso." - I called your teacher, I think she understood
11/21/19, 13:45 - Sara: Profesor de mierda? HAHAHHA
11/21/19, 13:45 - Sara: La hija de paco*
11/21/19, 13:46 - Sara: *tiene que trabajar tanto
11/21/19, 13:46 - Sara: Hahahahha
11/21/19, 13:46 - Sara: Thanks daddy
11/21/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Right, I forgot to say at the beginning: "no hablo español" my bad
11/21/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: If somehow I ever have a child, I hope it never calls me daddy, that word was ruined for me in that sense xd
11/21/19, 13:49 - Sara: ~Am I the only one who can call you that?~
11/21/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, now you are La hija de Kamil, deal with it
11/21/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Alternatively, la hija de Polaco, perhaps it sounds better
11/21/19, 13:57 - Sara: Del Polaco*
11/21/19, 13:58 - Sara: Can I call you during sex like that?
11/21/19, 13:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot guarantee that I won't run away in terror, but you can try
11/21/19, 13:59 - Sara: Daddy sounds better, see?
11/21/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe Papi? xd
11/21/19, 13:59 - Sara: Papi chulo
11/21/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
11/21/19, 14:00 - Sara: https://youtu.be/kVsYckNXYqM
11/21/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
11/21/19, 14:05 - Sara: I’m fine
11/21/19, 14:05 - Sara: Less stressed but still
11/21/19, 14:05 - Sara: Having lunch with my friend Maria
11/21/19, 14:05 - Sara: You?
11/21/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Building a small programming project
11/21/19, 14:06 - Sara: Tell me what it is about ^^
11/21/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: WhatsApp chat analyser
11/21/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: How many messages, words, most used words etc.
11/21/19, 14:07 - Sara: Ohhh cool
11/21/19, 14:07 - Sara: Seems useful
11/21/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Since the beginning you sent 24845 messages xd
11/21/19, 14:08 - Sara: Nudes*
11/21/19, 14:08 - Sara: How do you know it?
11/21/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's possible to export the whole chat as a text file
11/21/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then it's quite simple to analyze
11/21/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I sent only 14293, damn, I'm so behind xd
11/21/19, 14:16 - Sara: Damn
11/21/19, 14:16 - Sara: You talk so little
11/21/19, 14:17 - Sara: And which analysis?
11/21/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I just started, so for now, just number of messages
11/21/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I will add average number of words per message, most used words and other similar stuff
11/21/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a very nice practice project
11/21/19, 14:21 - Sara: I’m curious now :B
11/21/19, 14:21 - Sara: And whivh conversations are you going to analyse?
11/21/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: It works with any conversation, for now, probably ours because it has the most messages
11/21/19, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will definitely count the number of 'xd' xd
11/21/19, 14:24 - Sara: Yas 💕 if you need something tell me
11/21/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unless you recently learned how to program, I don't think you can help xd
11/21/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine, I'll go running now
11/21/19, 14:27 - Sara: Enjoy ^^
11/21/19, 14:29 - Sara: Keep checking your mail

11/21/19, 15:13 - Sara: I know it has been sent
11/21/19, 15:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is no tracking?
11/21/19, 15:14 - Sara: If I knew how it works xd
11/21/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a letter or a package?

11/21/19, 20:01 - Sara: I have been thinking about it almost 2 years xd
11/21/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: It takes time to heal, I think, no?
11/21/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe after I leave?
11/21/19, 20:02 - Sara: Yep
11/21/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or just a fake one?
11/21/19, 20:02 - Sara: Depending on the zone

11/21/19, 20:11 - Sara: How is it going,
11/21/19, 20:11 - Sara: ?

11/21/19, 20:12 - Sara: Was it nice?
11/21/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: This song came up on my Playlist while I was running https://youtu.be/9BMwcO6_hyA
11/21/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: And for some reason I started thinking about you
11/21/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: And running went surprisingly well
11/21/19, 20:14 - Sara: Oh that song you wrote ♥
11/21/19, 20:14 - Sara: :)
11/21/19, 20:14 - Sara: Why? ^^

11/21/19, 20:18 - Sara: Aw 💗
11/21/19, 20:18 - Sara: It is good for you have these ~premonitions~ dreams
11/21/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, while running I imagined singing that song in Patrick Foley while standing on a bar with you so it was quite nice too
11/21/19, 20:19 - Sara: Amazing!
11/21/19, 20:20 - Sara: Was in the karaoke?

11/21/19, 20:20 - Sara: It is like wtf
11/21/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, my dream from last night was also weird as hell but I don't remember many details
11/21/19, 20:21 - Sara: I dreamt about, for no reason and not knowing the context, that i said “Kamil is getting bold?” And that is
11/21/19, 20:22 - Sara: Xd
11/21/19, 20:22 - Sara: Romantic af

11/21/19, 20:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still trying to process this, it seems to be missing something
11/21/19, 20:24 - Sara: My life is coursed
11/21/19, 20:24 - Sara: I swear I only remember that 😂😂
11/21/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe it was a wet dream then 💦
11/21/19, 20:25 - Sara: Pffff
11/21/19, 20:25 - Sara: Amazing hahahha
11/21/19, 20:25 - Sara: Only a second of it
11/21/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I heard that sex can cause memory loss xd
11/21/19, 20:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe dream sex too
11/21/19, 20:25 - Sara: I’m fucked up then
11/21/19, 20:26 - Sara: Am I? XD

11/21/19, 20:26 - Sara: Xdddd
11/21/19, 20:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 20:28 - Sara: I feel weird
11/21/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: To Poland of course, it's too cold for Spanish dreams/nightmares
11/21/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
11/21/19, 20:29 - Sara: Brr 🥶
11/21/19, 20:29 - Sara: My hair
11/21/19, 20:29 - Sara: Reminds me to when I used to have red hair
11/21/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm actually surprised how much I like it
11/21/19, 20:30 - Sara: Really?
11/21/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I can't believe it either 😋
11/21/19, 20:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 20:30 - Sara: Why?
11/21/19, 20:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>

11/21/19, 20:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh
11/21/19, 20:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 20:31 - Sara: You don’t normally like dyed hair?
11/21/19, 20:32 - Sara: What
11/21/19, 20:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I don't have any problem with it, I just was a bit sceptical about the color, but it's actually very nice
11/21/19, 20:32 - Sara: Why?
11/21/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I was just used to your old one that I liked, I don't know
11/21/19, 20:33 - Sara: I’m the same I guess
11/21/19, 20:33 - Sara: You really have an image of me, don’t you?
11/21/19, 20:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: A lot of them, actually
11/21/19, 20:34 - Sara: What do you mean?
11/21/19, 20:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: At this point probably over 200 images 😋
11/21/19, 20:34 - Sara: Ha ha ha
11/21/19, 20:35 - Sara: So funny :p
11/21/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
11/21/19, 20:35 - Sara: Nah, I meant the picture of me as a person
11/21/19, 20:35 - Sara: Like... you don’t want me to change
11/21/19, 20:35 - Sara: Because there is only one physical aspect you like
11/21/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a little bit of sadness connected to changes, not only yours, but in general, but I don't oppose them
11/21/19, 20:36 - Sara: Sadness?
11/21/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: And don't assume that, you are much more than your looks
11/21/19, 20:37 - Sara: I know
11/21/19, 20:37 - Sara: But the hair, the piercings... you guve them too much importance
11/21/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Piercings, yes, I agree, I didn't say anything about the hair
11/21/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I can have my opinion but it doesn't mean that I won't to tell you what to do, not at all
11/21/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: *want
11/21/19, 20:38 - Sara: But tbh when I told you, i didn’t feel your support
11/21/19, 20:38 - Sara: Or even kind of obligation of not doing it
11/21/19, 20:39 - Sara: I have never received these kind of opinions, i’m surprised
11/21/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: This was way too much, I'm sorry, I don't know why I said all that
11/21/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to oppose it in any way, but neither support it, I'll prefer to stay neutral
11/21/19, 20:40 - Sara: That is okay
11/21/19, 20:40 - Sara: I was thinking
11/21/19, 20:40 - Sara: I’m not your kind of girl?
11/21/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
11/21/19, 20:41 - Sara: If you like girls like me
11/21/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: What exactly is a girl like you?
11/21/19, 20:42 - Sara: I guess mainly metalhead, fan of piercings and tattoos, sometimes dyies her hair, likes wearing black
11/21/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I don't have any love for piercings and tattoos, the rest, I don't mind, I don't have a strict type, I don't put myself in some sort of shackles, if I like someone, I just do, I don't go around looking for my perfect princess
11/21/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like you, whether you like it or not
11/21/19, 20:45 - Sara: Really?
11/21/19, 20:47 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you really need to ask that question then I guess I failed
11/21/19, 20:48 - Sara: It was a rhetorical one
11/21/19, 20:48 - Sara: Failing? I’m not an exam to pass, please
11/21/19, 20:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Failed to make you feel like I like you, I mean
11/21/19, 20:48 - Sara: Again, i don’t doubt about it
11/21/19, 20:49 - Sara: What is the use of talking about this? x)
11/21/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, you started that 🤷‍♂️
11/21/19, 20:49 - Sara: Sorry
11/21/19, 20:50 - Sara: Just feel a little bit judged or in the eye of the hurracain
11/21/19, 20:50 - Sara: And I shouldn’t
11/21/19, 20:50 - Sara: Maybe these events that came overwhelmed me a bit
11/21/19, 20:50 - Sara: And we haven’t done skype
11/21/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I won't mention any modifications you do with a single word, your choices, who am I to judge them, you are supposed to feel good in your body, nobody else
11/21/19, 20:51 - Sara: You can talk about that
11/21/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have time 💋
11/21/19, 20:51 - Sara: I talk about your body when ypu exercise
11/21/19, 20:51 - Sara: I’ll see if I have
11/21/19, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: But what is the use, my opinion on them hasn't really changed
11/21/19, 20:52 - Sara: I know
11/21/19, 20:53 - Sara: But you can just support a person
11/21/19, 20:53 - Sara: Well, better to put this topic aside
11/21/19, 20:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will never tell you a compliment that I don't truly believe is true
11/21/19, 20:54 - Sara: Fair enough
11/21/19, 20:54 - Sara: But I said support
11/21/19, 20:54 - Sara: Not lying
11/21/19, 20:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so what is that even in that case?
11/21/19, 20:55 - Sara: Not saying to the other person that they’d look bad
11/21/19, 20:55 - Sara: Or at least in a better way
11/21/19, 20:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's more like just not interfering and judging rather than supporting and I already said that I intend to do that
11/21/19, 20:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: But well, the exact naming is not very important, fair enough
11/21/19, 20:56 - Sara: I guess
11/21/19, 20:56 - Sara: But you have me the impression you will dislike me if I wear somethig “you don’t like”
11/21/19, 20:56 - Sara: Gave*
11/21/19, 20:56 - Sara: Not a good feeling I guess
11/21/19, 20:57 - Sara: That is why I asked
11/21/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I realized that later, sorry
11/21/19, 20:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want to make you feel that way because of me, sorry
11/21/19, 20:58 - Sara: It is okay
11/21/19, 20:58 - Sara: Like i don’t to imagine that the person who is dating me thinks i’m horrible
11/21/19, 20:59 - Sara: If i’m trying to change you tell me and I stop, because that is not m intention
11/21/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess we can just end the topic, simply do what will make you happy and I will support it by not interfering in any way
11/21/19, 21:00 - Sara: Okay
11/21/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Damn, it's almost time for the last esn party, write on white 😢
11/21/19, 21:02 - Sara: I have seen

11/21/19, 21:10 - Sara: Trying to convince myself xD
11/21/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should probably try out everything you want to change for at least a few months before deciding 😋
11/21/19, 21:45 - Sara: Hahaha
11/21/19, 21:45 - Sara: You don’t recognize me xD
11/21/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 22:45 - Sara: I can be free soon
11/21/19, 22:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a bit of a problem with the internet today, I think my computer started updating without asking me for permission but I'll try to make it work
11/21/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I definitely want to at least try
11/21/19, 22:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

11/22/19, 13:00 - Sara: We have to wait a bit but I hope that is a good sign
11/22/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: "I'm really sorry, you have knee cancer"
11/22/19, 13:01 - Sara: Imagine xD

11/22/19, 13:02 - Sara: Seguro que estás estudiando mucho
11/22/19, 13:02 - Sara: Ánimo, bebé
11/22/19, 13:05 - Sara: I have just read that we fuck depending on how we cook
11/22/19, 13:06 - Sara: Estoy jodida
11/22/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't cook at all so that explains a lot xd
11/22/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cooked in Ghent and everything was different
11/22/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Shit, it's trueee 😲

11/22/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Run, Sara, ruuuun 🏃
11/22/19, 13:33 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: So everything is fine and you have no more restrictions?
11/22/19, 13:33 - Sara: Not at all
11/22/19, 13:33 - Sara: They recommended me to wait one month to do more effort in exercise
11/22/19, 13:33 - Sara: But I can start running and these things
11/22/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: No knee cancer 😢
11/22/19, 13:33 - Sara: Not unfortunately :(
11/22/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cool, I'm in a pretty good shape now so you need to catch up before I visit 👍
11/22/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you can do 10km with a pace, let's say, 5 minutes per kilometer we will be fine 😋
11/22/19, 13:35 - Sara: You do that?
11/22/19, 13:35 - Sara: Damn
11/22/19, 13:35 - Sara: I’m a fat ball xd
11/22/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's pretty slow, tbh xd
11/22/19, 13:36 - Sara: I’ll try to check how much I can do
11/22/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I use runkeeper app to track my runs, I think it's quite nice
11/22/19, 13:36 - Sara: Maybe not running but I can try when the weather is better
11/22/19, 13:36 - Sara: Okaay
11/22/19, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just don't get discouraged, it's been some time so it will probably be a bit difficult
11/22/19, 13:37 - Sara: Okay
11/22/19, 13:38 - Sara: It’s been a while since i don’t do real exercise I guess
11/22/19, 13:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Starting the activities is difficult but it is worth it to get through that
11/22/19, 13:40 - Sara: That happened to you?
11/22/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Partially, I didn't run in Ghent and first few tries after coming back to Poland were difficult
11/22/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But after a week or two I noticed improvement
11/22/19, 13:42 - Sara: Okay
11/22/19, 13:42 - Sara: I’ll see what i can do
11/22/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: And now I feel much better about it and myself, so in my opinion, worth it
11/22/19, 13:42 - Sara: Nice
11/22/19, 13:42 - Sara: Only running?
11/22/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mostly yes, at least at the moment
11/22/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Regular exercising feels a bit boring to me
11/22/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I intend to try rock climbing or something like that instead but I had a problem with my back so I had to wait
11/22/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But now it's better so I'll try to schedule something
11/22/19, 13:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although maybe I'll wait until after the trip because I don't want to risk injury before that
11/22/19, 13:45 - Sara: Better 💕
11/22/19, 13:46 - Sara: We can do exercise together (?
11/22/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, I don't mind 😊
11/22/19, 13:49 - Sara: Which kind?
11/22/19, 13:49 - Sara: I’ll try to do some exercise, but idk if i’ll have time
11/22/19, 13:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: This https://urbanplanetjump.es/?lang=en
11/22/19, 13:50 - Sara: Do you want me to check it?
11/22/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: if we have time, why not
11/22/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have two very similar ones in Lodz and I relly like them
11/22/19, 13:51 - Sara: Okay ^^
11/22/19, 13:51 - Sara: This one is a little bit far I think
11/22/19, 13:51 - Sara: Colmenar Viejo is in the very north of Madrid
11/22/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, maybe there are other ones, we'll have to check
11/22/19, 13:52 - Sara: Yess
11/22/19, 13:52 - Sara: Madrid is very big
11/22/19, 13:53 - Sara: If not, the axes place is nice hahaha
11/22/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: according to google that's the address:  Calle de Mondragón, s/n, 28917 Leganés
11/22/19, 13:53 - Sara: Oh, Leganés? Well, 20-30 minutes by bus
11/22/19, 13:54 - Sara: I’m doing some  work for the bachellor project, maybe i check it later

11/22/19, 14:26 - Sara: I have checked some of the trampolin parks in Madrid and the nearest are 40 minutes far
11/22/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's not bad I guess, we'll see, if you'll feel like we can go
11/22/19, 14:34 - Sara: We can check if we have time
11/22/19, 14:34 - Sara: But i’m sure ^^
11/22/19, 14:34 - Sara: That is up to us
11/22/19, 14:34 - Sara: Next week I see it more specifically
11/22/19, 14:35 - Sara: Or today if i’m not so busy
11/22/19, 14:40 - Sara: If you like this, it is nice. Maybe it is too overwhelming?
11/22/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why overwhelming?
11/22/19, 14:42 - Sara: Well, maybe about the 3 days in a row goinf to different places, but we won’t arrive too late
11/22/19, 14:42 - Sara: If you like it, i go for it
11/22/19, 14:43 - Sara: I’m afraif of not being in Madrid that much to visit it but okay ^^
11/22/19, 15:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: We'll see, if everything goes well, I don't think it's going to be my last visit so I wouldn't worry too much
11/22/19, 15:09 - Sara: :)

11/22/19, 19:37 - Sara: And don’t fuck it up

11/22/19, 19:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I'm capable of producing sounds like that and it also would be better if the neighbors didn't alert the police about apparent murder sounds so I don't know 🤔

11/22/19, 20:41 - Sara: And anything new about emojis? XD
11/22/19, 20:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet, I've run into some issues and I'm trying to solve them now
11/22/19, 20:42 - Sara: Ohhh go for it!
11/22/19, 21:08 - Sara: Oh, I have news
11/22/19, 21:09 - Sara: Probably my parents want to go to Cuenca the saturday you are here, so we have free transport :B
11/22/19, 21:09 - Sara: It would be as well a 1 day trip
11/22/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yay, a future family road trip xd
11/22/19, 21:10 - Sara: HAHAHAH if you don't like it, just tell me
11/22/19, 21:10 - Sara: We would go on our own in Cuenca
11/22/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, no, it's ok, it's probably going to be quite funny xd
11/22/19, 21:11 - Sara: Why funny? hahaha
11/22/19, 21:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe awkward 🤔
11/22/19, 21:11 - Sara: You'll know the famous Cuenca I have always talked about
11/22/19, 21:11 - Sara: Up to you, for me there is not any problem
11/22/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine with that, I'll bravely face Paco
11/22/19, 21:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😼
11/22/19, 21:12 - Sara: hahahahaha
11/22/19, 21:12 - Sara: So I can organise that
11/22/19, 21:13 - Sara: I'll see it now
11/22/19, 21:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine by me 👍
11/22/19, 21:13 - Sara: I have some time
11/22/19, 21:13 - Sara: Segovia, El Escorial or free time?
11/22/19, 21:13 - Sara: Wait
11/22/19, 21:13 - Sara: I'll try to see it
11/22/19, 21:15 - Sara: But now I'm thinking that maybe it is not okay for us
11/22/19, 21:15 - Sara: wait wait
11/22/19, 21:15 - Sara: I'll talk to them, but i think I have some ideas
11/22/19, 21:43 - Sara: I think I have some kind of idea x)
11/22/19, 21:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/22/19, 21:47 - Sara: This is driving me insane hahahahaha i should start at the end of next week, because Idk what will happen in that week
11/22/19, 21:48 - Sara: Or if I can skip any class
11/22/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you already, it's probably not my last visit, simply spending time with you is enough, we don't need to run around every day
11/22/19, 21:49 - Sara: :)
11/22/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: So don't worry, we'll figure something out 😊
11/22/19, 21:49 - Sara: Sure? Okay
11/22/19, 21:49 - Sara: But I want you to spend a good time here
11/22/19, 21:49 - Sara: And I like organizing stuff
11/22/19, 21:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, I want to visit things, yes, but if it's too complex, don't worry, I don't need to see the whole Spain in that one week 😘
11/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: Okay
11/22/19, 21:51 - Sara: You can also tell me
11/22/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: If we just chill, go to the amusement park, arcade or whatever, it's also very nice, I'm going not only for sigthseeing
11/22/19, 21:52 - Sara: Okay :)
11/22/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: So don't stress about it, it will be fine 💋
11/22/19, 21:53 - Sara: You prefer staying in Madrid?
11/22/19, 21:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok with traveling around, I'm just saying that if it's going to be difficult than it's not necessary, spending a day or two just enjoying the city, the way I would if I lived there is also a good option
11/22/19, 22:03 - Sara: Okay :)
11/22/19, 22:03 - Sara: I’ll see
11/22/19, 22:05 - Sara: I thought you wanted to travel
11/22/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your plan is OK but if it's difficult to organize than this is also very nice
11/22/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't need to travel every day I am there, you know
11/22/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like this idea with arcade, trampoline Park or something of that sort is also great for me
11/23/19, 03:32 - Sara: I’ll try to focus on this
11/23/19, 03:32 - Sara: You are here to focus on the other and to spend time together
11/23/19, 03:32 - Sara: ♥
11/23/19, 13:34 - Sara: https://trib.al/opHbw2C
11/23/19, 14:38 - Sara: Oh mamma
11/23/19, 14:38 - Sara: The package is in Poland already 😌
11/23/19, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, well, how about *NO*
11/23/19, 15:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, I'll look for the postman 😘
11/23/19, 15:19 - Sara: Just keep an eye next week ^^
11/23/19, 15:19 - Sara: Are you okay?
11/23/19, 15:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I went to the geothermal pools, it was very nice
11/23/19, 15:20 - Sara: Ohhhh tell me tell me 😌😌😌😌💕😊💕
11/23/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, today is a bit cold (3-4 degrees) so going between the pools was fun xd
11/23/19, 15:21 - Sara: Brrrr 🥶
11/23/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the water was great, 35 degrees so quite warm 😊
11/23/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the summer there are also water slides and a bar but now unfortunately they are closed
11/23/19, 15:22 - Sara: So cool
11/23/19, 15:22 - Sara: Envyyyyyy
11/23/19, 15:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: There were points on the floor were water was coming from and it was creating a lot of bubbles, basically sort of like much stronger jacuzzi
11/23/19, 15:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also very nice
11/23/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: And when I saw them I imagined that you would probably like them a lot xd
11/23/19, 15:24 - Sara: For anything in specific?
11/23/19, 15:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: With the way they worked I imagine that they are basically clitoral stimulation points xd
11/23/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, if the shower is enough than this for sure would 😉
11/23/19, 15:26 - Sara: Pffffff
11/23/19, 15:26 - Sara: I have never masturbated in the shower
11/23/19, 15:26 - Sara: I should :(
11/23/19, 15:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: What? xd
11/23/19, 15:28 - Sara: You always think about me in relation to sex HAHAH
11/23/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not always but this particular thing simply was like that, come on 😜
11/23/19, 15:29 - Sara: I know I know ahha
11/23/19, 15:29 - Sara: It is funny
11/23/19, 15:29 - Sara: You are jealous of not having it
11/23/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sure that you are curious now xd
11/23/19, 15:29 - Sara: About the bubbles? Yes
11/23/19, 15:30 - Sara: About the shower? As well
11/23/19, 15:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, not sex but your pleasure, there is a difference
11/23/19, 15:31 - Sara: Masturbation is sex as well, i think xD
11/23/19, 15:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I just thought that you would like it, I'm actually pretty sure that you would 🙄
11/23/19, 15:32 - Sara: And I’ll will
11/23/19, 15:32 - Sara: Don’t doubt about that ahha
11/23/19, 15:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I was thinking that it would be nice to visit similar place with you
11/23/19, 15:32 - Sara: 😌
11/23/19, 15:32 - Sara: Yes please
11/23/19, 15:33 - Sara: Maybe we can go to the termal place in Toledo

11/23/19, 15:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it's fine, any plan is ok, I guess 😊
11/23/19, 15:36 - Sara: Sure?
11/23/19, 15:36 - Sara: Maybe i’m thinking about going only to Cuenca and Madrid
11/23/19, 15:36 - Sara: And Toledo
11/23/19, 15:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Will you have time for a call later? Could be nice to discuss it a bit

11/23/19, 16:22 - Sara: Yay

11/23/19, 16:23 - Sara: And If i’m pregnant?
11/23/19, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Abortion or just kill it afterwards, come on Sara, this is basic knowledge
11/23/19, 16:24 - Sara: Or sell it
11/23/19, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Children are bad, but your child would be basically antichrist

11/24/19, 13:22 - Sara: Yes, jus for fun
11/24/19, 13:23 - Sara: I wish I could upload Gabriel’s and these ones to somewhere for modeling
11/24/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: You would like to have a career in modeling?
11/24/19, 13:25 - Sara: Yes
11/24/19, 13:25 - Sara: It could be nice
11/24/19, 13:26 - Sara: If they respect my body haha
11/24/19, 13:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was going to say that you would probably need to give up the donuts xd
11/24/19, 13:33 - Sara: And shave xd
11/24/19, 13:33 - Sara: Or maybe that is my feature
11/24/19, 13:33 - Sara: Xd
11/24/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: You could be in the commercials for brushes for armpit hair xd
11/24/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/24/19, 14:01 - Sara: Perfect 💗
11/24/19, 14:01 - Sara: So big :o
11/24/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Big but still beautiful 💕
11/24/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is there an ice rink in Madrid?
11/24/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/24/19, 15:07 - Sara: Yes 💕
11/24/19, 15:07 - Sara: 💋💋💋
11/24/19, 15:08 - Sara: You are a burrito then :)
11/24/19, 15:08 - Sara: 🌯
11/24/19, 15:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me? Why?
11/24/19, 15:14 - Sara: :)
11/24/19, 15:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/24/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: About what?
11/24/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree that you are not mysterious and intimidating, smart is questionable xd
11/24/19, 16:04 - Sara: People consider me like that 😂
11/24/19, 16:04 - Sara: Xddddd
11/24/19, 16:04 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/24/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what do you think about the results?
11/24/19, 16:12 - Sara: Mmmmmmm
11/24/19, 16:12 - Sara: I don’t consider myself that childish or fragile
11/24/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe they meant sweet 💋
11/24/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: The options you gave are a bit meh, tbh
11/24/19, 16:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would probably say the last two options ~minus funny xd~
11/24/19, 16:15 - Sara: 💕
11/24/19, 16:15 - Sara: Yes... too general?
11/24/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, also mixed positive with negative a bit
11/24/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, if you could be described in three words I would be worried that you have no personality xd
11/24/19, 16:17 - Sara: Which ones are negatives for you?
11/24/19, 16:17 - Sara: Why? Hahaha
11/24/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe more like traits not necessarily fitting together
11/24/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like smart and intimidating for example
11/24/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or sweet and childish
11/24/19, 16:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: If the personality can be well described in 3 words than I'm afraid that there is not much personality actually
11/24/19, 16:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: People are more complex than that
11/24/19, 16:20 - Sara: True
11/24/19, 16:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, for me at least last two options plus sweet from the first one, plus smart from second ~(questionable though xd)~
11/24/19, 16:20 - Sara: And more than prototypes I think
11/24/19, 16:21 - Sara: Hate you :p
11/24/19, 16:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hate you too ❤️
11/24/19, 16:23 - Sara: 💋
11/24/19, 16:23 - Sara: Which one are you? Mmm
11/24/19, 16:23 - Sara: Second?
11/24/19, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Am I that simple?
11/24/19, 16:24 - Sara: Nop
11/24/19, 16:24 - Sara: But if I had to answer to that pool
11/24/19, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Am I intimidating?
11/24/19, 16:24 - Sara: Not that much
11/24/19, 16:24 - Sara: But smart and mysterious
11/24/19, 16:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's my problem with this poll, not all traits from an option fit in many cases
11/24/19, 16:29 - Sara: Yep
11/24/19, 16:30 - Sara: I agree
11/24/19, 16:30 - Sara: Are you okay?
11/24/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, going back home
11/24/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?

11/24/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lovely 😘
11/24/19, 16:31 - Sara: Yay :B
11/24/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, we've been mostly walking around the shopping center, terribly boring
11/24/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last hour or so we went bowling
11/24/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: And now I know that I actually don't like bowling xd
11/24/19, 16:32 - Sara: Why boring?
11/24/19, 16:32 - Sara: Por qué? :p
11/24/19, 16:32 - Sara: :o

11/24/19, 18:34 - Sara: Now you are proud xd
11/24/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, it's still eurovision xd
11/24/19, 18:35 - Sara: What is wrong with eurovision? XD
11/24/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stop asking obvious questions, please Sarrito-burrito
11/24/19, 18:37 - Sara: It is great
11/24/19, 18:37 - Sara: A fucking lie

11/24/19, 18:44 - Sara: Okay 💋
11/24/19, 20:13 - Sara: Hey, Kamil. I think I'm going to have dinner now because I want to write part of an assignment but I'm too tired for that now. If I feel like writing it, around 9:30 I can be available. If I don't feel like, just after dinner :P xD

11/24/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: This one makes me laugh though, I don't know why xd
11/24/19, 21:08 - Sara: The lack of ass makes me laugh as well xd
11/24/19, 21:08 - Sara: Maybe non-natural position
11/24/19, 21:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: What ass?
11/24/19, 21:08 - Sara: That is what i mean
11/24/19, 21:08 - Sara: Hahaha sad

11/24/19, 23:17 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 00:43 - Sara: Sorry for all of this, I’m very sensitive because I feel i’m in a risky situation with you, i’m seeing how our relation can be
11/25/19, 00:45 - Sara: Like if I’d feel like this all the time with every comment you say, I don’t being like this and thinking that my possible couple does not accept that, at least in these moments, I’m not okay with this comments. It makes me feel i’m not enough... yes, I feel what you felt now
11/25/19, 00:47 - Sara: I don’t want us hurting the otheR, even less if it is for avoidable reasons
11/25/19, 00:48 - Sara: Or meaningless
11/25/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, I understand that, I am afraid that I am giving you an image that is not really true, although tbh, I don't really know how what exactly is the true image, I'm afraid that you pay more attention to the mistakes and problems and I feel like with my every action I can fuck everything up and that stresses me a lot
11/25/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really want this to work out and I'm just afraid that it won't
11/25/19, 00:49 - Sara: Sorry
11/25/19, 00:49 - Sara: Me too
11/25/19, 00:50 - Sara: But for me an important, and I have my right to feel respected
11/25/19, 00:50 - Sara: If you don’t like something I do and I can change it, i’d do it
11/25/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I'm not saying otherwise
11/25/19, 00:51 - Sara: Thanks
11/25/19, 00:51 - Sara: Amd sorry
11/25/19, 00:52 - Sara: Good night misiu
11/25/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenas noches corazón
11/25/19, 00:53 - Sara: :,)
11/25/19, 00:53 - Sara: Many things can be solved with a hug
11/25/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which also makes me afraid of what happens after my trip
11/25/19, 00:56 - Sara: Why?
11/25/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: We may solve our problems when we meet in person, I know that at least least for me, it's significantly different than talking things over by phone, but what will happen if we have some problems later and the next possibility to meet will be months away?
11/25/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, in person it all just works so much better
11/25/19, 10:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 10:40 - Sara: I understand
11/25/19, 10:40 - Sara: HAHHAHA

11/25/19, 10:43 - Sara: That is nice
11/25/19, 10:43 - Sara: Sorry for yesterday
11/25/19, 10:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: It wasn't your fault, I am sorry

11/25/19, 11:27 - Sara: Aaaaah I understand everything now
11/25/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🚙 🍑
11/25/19, 11:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, imagine all the tracks I can set up, and there is even a tunnel 😏
11/25/19, 11:30 - Sara: Oh la la

11/25/19, 17:11 - Sara: At least, Can I fuck you?
11/25/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, you cannot
11/25/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Especially not after skipping a class for that reason

11/25/19, 21:16 - Sara: Well
11/25/19, 21:16 - Sara: In general
11/25/19, 21:17 - Sara: Who doesn’t like ass?
11/25/19, 21:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, some people maybe prefer boobs
11/25/19, 21:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although at certain angle, boobs also can look kind of similar to ass
11/25/19, 21:20 - Sara: Do you?
11/25/19, 21:20 - Sara: Xddd wow
11/25/19, 21:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe ass can look similar to boobs 🤔
11/25/19, 21:20 - Sara: Such a philosopher
11/25/19, 21:20 - Sara: Well yes
11/25/19, 21:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: To ass or not to ass
11/25/19, 21:21 - Sara: There is a scientific explanation
11/25/19, 21:21 - Sara: Idk if you know it
11/25/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rings a bell but I don't remember
11/25/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: That is the question
11/25/19, 21:22 - Sara: I tell you later
11/25/19, 21:22 - Sara: Whixh one so you preferV
11/25/19, 21:22 - Sara: ?
11/25/19, 21:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: First I need to ponder on the nature of the ass
11/25/19, 21:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: What does it mean to a human being to ass
11/25/19, 21:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once I answer the existential question of what it means to ass, I can decide to ass or not to ass
11/25/19, 22:33 - Sara: Pfff
11/25/19, 22:33 - Sara: Hahahaha
11/25/19, 22:33 - Sara: To ass
11/25/19, 22:33 - Sara: To eat it?
11/25/19, 22:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or to be an asshole
11/25/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Always sexual, so bad
11/25/19, 22:34 - Sara: Xdddd
11/25/19, 22:34 - Sara: Well, youhave to decide this xD
11/25/19, 22:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still not interested btw xd
11/25/19, 22:34 - Sara: I know xD
11/25/19, 22:35 - Sara: You have a different image about me
11/25/19, 22:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
11/25/19, 22:37 - Sara: Males used to look at female asses for reproductive reason when we walked with 4 limbs. However, when we started using only two, males didn’t have this attribute to look at. Reason why, boobs are like ass
11/25/19, 22:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least they don't smell like ass xd
11/25/19, 22:38 - Sara: Just that I’m not a perv

11/25/19, 22:41 - Sara: Okay
11/25/19, 22:41 - Sara: I hope that is not the focus
11/25/19, 22:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not, but since you mentioned it...
11/25/19, 22:44 - Sara: Lol
11/25/19, 22:44 - Sara: Sorry, I was joking
11/25/19, 22:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, me too, I definitely don't mind sexual jokes

11/25/19, 22:50 - Sara: Well, in the sex shop haha
11/25/19, 22:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something similar like last time?
11/25/19, 22:52 - Sara: Yep
11/25/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's probably something that I should attend more than you, but well, later you can bestow on me your newly acquired knowledge
11/25/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍑🙌
11/25/19, 22:54 - Sara: Of course babe
11/25/19, 22:55 - Sara: Or idk if going to watch a short movie about gender violence, i’ll see
11/25/19, 22:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: How was the manifestation?
11/25/19, 22:57 - Sara: Well... not bad, but we have seen things we didn’t like
11/25/19, 22:57 - Sara: Do you know what is a terf?
11/25/19, 22:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: A transphobic feminist?
11/25/19, 22:57 - Sara: Yep
11/25/19, 22:57 - Sara: Now they are called FART
11/25/19, 22:58 - Sara: I don’t consider them feminist because they still hate women
11/25/19, 22:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe that's what it means to ass
11/25/19, 22:58 - Sara: And we have seen them and i wanted to kick their asses
11/25/19, 22:59 - Sara: asses are really nice to associate them with terfs
11/25/19, 22:59 - Sara: Also, people were trying to sell feminist stuff (even food) for personal benefit
11/25/19, 22:59 - Sara: Also, the idea about political parties in them... i don’t know
11/25/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: That always happens, no matter the cause
11/25/19, 23:00 - Sara: And that is shit
11/25/19, 23:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's shit that people try to profit from that, but it's not illegal
11/25/19, 23:00 - Sara: Fuck capitalism
11/25/19, 23:00 - Sara: I know but... uf
11/25/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I don't like it either
11/25/19, 23:01 - Sara: ~Paris~
11/25/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: The twitch of cities
11/25/19, 23:01 - Sara: Hajajaha

11/25/19, 23:02 - Sara: Thank god
11/25/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably for the best 👍
11/25/19, 23:03 - Sara: True
11/25/19, 23:03 - Sara: I hope someday you like Paris
11/25/19, 23:03 - Sara: But Madrid is better
11/25/19, 23:03 - Sara: I know for sure
11/25/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why bother with Paris when Florence exists
11/25/19, 23:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/25/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Please, people say that Paris is a romantic city, well, compared to Florence it's a shithole
11/25/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most beautiful city, nothing else to add ❤️
11/25/19, 23:06 - Sara: Because of the company?
11/25/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, because of the city
11/25/19, 23:06 - Sara: :,(
11/25/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, Andrea and Arturo live near Florence, Paris doesn't stand a chance when compared to Florence
11/25/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Notre Dame is such crap compared to Santa Maria del Fiore
11/25/19, 23:11 - Sara: Definifely
11/25/19, 23:11 - Sara: Good company indeed
11/25/19, 23:11 - Sara: Different moments
11/25/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Even in my best moments I would never pick Paris over Florence
11/25/19, 23:12 - Sara: That is so Kamil :p
11/25/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, can you seriously argue about which city is better?
11/25/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, more beautiful
11/25/19, 23:13 - Sara: In mu case you mean?
11/25/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/25/19, 23:16 - Sara: Ohhh
11/25/19, 23:16 - Sara: I have my favs
11/25/19, 23:16 - Sara: But many places
11/25/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: But which one is in your opinion more beautiful: Paris or Florence?
11/25/19, 23:17 - Sara: They are different
11/25/19, 23:17 - Sara: But i have different experiences
11/25/19, 23:17 - Sara: Florence is way better
11/25/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me, without considering the mood I had in these places, the buildings, monuments etc. simply look better in Florence, the streets are fantastic, it's not so huge, nobody tries to sell me stuff on the street, simply amazing
11/25/19, 23:19 - Sara: It was great, yes
11/25/19, 23:19 - Sara: The views and the cathedral are insane
11/25/19, 23:20 - Sara: But they are different places
11/25/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: View from Piazzale Michelangelo was fantastic, from Sacre Coeur and Notre Dame, nothing special
11/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: Different
11/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: But agree Florence was insane
11/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: I’d go back there x10000
11/25/19, 23:23 - Sara: Don’t get me wrong
11/25/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that people want to go on romantic trips to Paris when they can go to Florence, insane xd
11/25/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably they just lack the knowledge
11/25/19, 23:25 - Sara: hahaha what do you consider romantic? 🌝
11/25/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Florence*
11/25/19, 23:25 - Sara: I mean xD
11/25/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Not Paris*
11/25/19, 23:26 - Sara: Ahahaha
11/25/19, 23:26 - Sara: But now seriously :)
11/25/19, 23:26 - Sara: You like comic places btw?
11/25/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Walking around the streets of Florence together, just the whole mood of that place, admiring beautiful architecture and sculptures
11/25/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably could be some other city too, but so far I haven't found any like that
11/25/19, 23:28 - Sara: Nice
11/25/19, 23:29 - Sara: I hope ~we~ you will know :)
11/25/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already know one, if I find more, great, if not, that particular one is quite enough ❤️
11/25/19, 23:30 - Sara: True :)
11/25/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean by comic?
11/25/19, 23:30 - Sara: Places where they sell comics
11/25/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, why do you ask?
11/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: In instagram, one told me a good comic shop to go HAHHA
11/25/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Could be interesting to visit 😊
11/25/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you can make a poll in Instagram which city is better? 😂
11/25/19, 23:32 - Sara: There is a zone in Madrid literally with some of them
11/25/19, 23:32 - Sara: Do you want? 😂
11/25/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, why not actually
11/25/19, 23:33 - Sara: 😂😂
11/25/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although, since I will vote for Florence, I already know that Paris will win 😢
11/25/19, 23:33 - Sara: XD

11/26/19, 14:55 - Sara: It is the same
11/26/19, 14:55 - Sara: We can use both
11/26/19, 14:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Weird 🤔
11/26/19, 16:55 - Sara: Why? Better for you to remember it:p
11/26/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why have 2 types of conjugation of the same thing that are equivalent?
11/26/19, 16:58 - Sara: Idk

11/26/19, 16:58 - Sara: Studying it?

11/26/19, 17:01 - Sara: Again, both can be use equally
11/26/19, 17:02 - Sara: Probably it is for etymological reasons

11/27/19, 23:02 - Sara: And that is sad
11/27/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's fine to make effort to look good but I agree that it shouldn't be a priority or something that causes anxiety
11/27/19, 23:04 - Sara: Yes but not
11/27/19, 23:04 - Sara: Women have been constantly told to be sexy, attrative, slim, pretty
11/27/19, 23:04 - Sara: And it is tiring
11/27/19, 23:05 - Sara: And it is a distraction for othe things
11/27/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you can also want to look better just for yourself I guess, that's what I do
11/27/19, 23:06 - Sara: Yes, of course
11/27/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, at least for me, I want to feel good, be active, sporty and the improved looks are just a nice bonus
11/27/19, 23:06 - Sara: But if it is for myself, i’ll try unconciously to look these standards
11/27/19, 23:06 - Sara: You will always look nice :=
11/27/19, 23:06 - Sara: :p
11/27/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you still intend to exercise and be more active, right?
11/27/19, 23:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need a running partner
11/27/19, 23:08 - Sara: Yes, of course
11/27/19, 23:08 - Sara: I hope I can start soon my exercise
11/27/19, 23:08 - Sara: Yes 💕
11/27/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lovely 💋
11/27/19, 23:09 - Sara: Will we run here? XD
11/27/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's more like a plan for the future xd
11/27/19, 23:10 - Sara: True
11/27/19, 23:10 - Sara: Oh
11/27/19, 23:10 - Sara: I haven’t told you about Enri
11/27/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: *The plot thickens*
11/27/19, 23:12 - Sara: Xd
11/27/19, 23:12 - Sara: What was the last thing I told you?
11/27/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: You send him a text explaining the situation
11/27/19, 23:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: *sent
11/27/19, 23:13 - Sara: Okaay
11/27/19, 23:14 - Sara: He said: I’m saying all of this because I trust you and I feel this empathy with you. I hope that all of this could remain between us
11/27/19, 23:15 - Sara: And I said, okay, i think the same but in a friendly way
11/27/19, 23:15 - Sara: He started imagining me in the bath and doing me an massage touching... well...
11/27/19, 23:15 - Sara: I told him I didn’t like it, for all the people involved and the lack of consent
11/27/19, 23:16 - Sara: He said: No Sara but it’s not that. Really I’m not using you. I’ll go ahead only if you want only if you share the same. Otherwise I’ll stop immediately
11/27/19, 23:16 - Sara: And I told him to stop
11/27/19, 23:16 - Sara: And he apologized and asked me if I was angry
11/27/19, 23:16 - Sara: And asked me: But when you have your moment, do you think sometimes to involve someone?
11/27/19, 23:17 - Sara: And I told him that if there is previpus agreement or any kind of relation, i would
11/27/19, 23:17 - Sara: And he understood
11/27/19, 23:17 - Sara: He told me and I was beautiful and I thanked him (idk I like qhen people tell me that)
11/27/19, 23:18 - Sara: And at the same time he wanted to send me a picture in the bathroom
11/27/19, 23:18 - Sara: And I send random photos to anyone, so I told him that he could but without any explicit content xd
11/27/19, 23:19 - Sara: And he changed the topic
11/27/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it was going to be a dick pic after all, a missed opportunity Sara xd
11/27/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But seriously, still weird
11/27/19, 23:20 - Sara: Xdd
11/27/19, 23:20 - Sara: Yep
11/27/19, 23:20 - Sara: What do you think?
11/27/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at least he stopped
11/27/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, if we meet again I don't know how it is going to be
11/27/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, he didn't want me to know this
11/27/19, 23:20 - Sara: Yep
11/27/19, 23:21 - Sara: I hope he forgets and everything goes like the same
11/27/19, 23:21 - Sara: I’d do it
11/27/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: But we are definitely going to the Arab bath
11/27/19, 23:21 - Sara: I don’t want to judge him for that
11/27/19, 23:21 - Sara: 😎
11/27/19, 23:22 - Sara: Should we male an appoinment?
11/27/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know, I won't really see him the same way anymore, I'm afraid
11/27/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, but which day?
11/27/19, 23:23 - Sara: In Madrid finally?
11/27/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe the day I arrive?
11/27/19, 23:24 - Sara: I was thinking about that
11/27/19, 23:24 - Sara: A more relaxing plan right?
11/27/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I might be tired so it would be nice to relax
11/27/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like that a lot
11/27/19, 23:24 - Sara: Great
11/27/19, 23:24 - Sara: I can check the hours if you want
11/27/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
11/27/19, 23:25 - Sara: I hope I know where I have my bikinis xd
11/27/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Making all these plans is making me impatient xd
11/27/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: 8 days 😋
11/27/19, 23:27 - Sara: Me tooo yay

11/27/19, 23:31 - Sara: Do you want me to buy it now?
11/27/19, 23:34 - Sara: It is only 20 minutes by foot/subway, not that far

11/28/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk to be honest, I can do that but I don't how this will work out
11/28/19, 17:21 - Sara: Well... if my sister goes, Madrid’s flat would be empty 🌚
11/28/19, 17:21 - Sara: Why?
11/28/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, it can be a bit awkward, I guess
11/28/19, 17:22 - Sara: You decide

11/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: :p
11/28/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm thinking if it's not too early for that, and I don't speak Spanish yet so that can be a bit of a problem too
11/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: Too early?
11/28/19, 17:32 - Sara: As well
11/28/19, 17:33 - Sara: Maybe it is a language problem
11/28/19, 17:33 - Sara: But you don’t need to come as a couple or anything
11/28/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then as who? I don't know anybody else so without you, I'll die there xd
11/28/19, 17:34 - Sara: If you are not comfortable, we won’t gp

11/28/19, 17:37 - Sara: Spamish ptsd? Xd
11/28/19, 17:37 - Sara: True :)
11/28/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, you barely spoke Spanish, so not really xd
11/28/19, 17:37 - Sara: Good :p
11/28/19, 17:38 - Sara: Maybe for people xd
11/28/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I wouldn't expect a spanish group to speak English more than the Italian group xd
11/28/19, 17:38 - Sara: Puf PUF
11/28/19, 17:38 - Sara: Depending hahaha
11/28/19, 17:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess my main problem is the language, I don't really mind going as a couple or not
11/28/19, 17:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Damn Spaniards speak too fast xd
11/28/19, 17:52 - Sara: You checked xD
11/28/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/28/19, 17:55 - Sara: And Italians? XD
11/28/19, 17:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't try to understand spoken Italian that much so I'm not sure xd
11/28/19, 18:02 - Sara: Probably similar haha
11/28/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, I ordered the piercing from Canada around one week ago so maybe it will arrive around the time I do
11/28/19, 18:48 - Sara: Cooool
11/28/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But maybe not, because they said 2 to 6 weeks xd
11/28/19, 18:53 - Sara: Too relative xD

11/28/19, 21:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: *concern
11/28/19, 21:23 - Sara: Outlandish?
11/28/19, 21:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ridiculous, or something similar
11/28/19, 21:23 - Sara: I don’t get what you mean
11/28/19, 21:23 - Sara: 😂

11/28/19, 21:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you calculate now the perfect angle and force for spanking, based on the curvature of the ass?
11/28/19, 21:29 - Sara: Not the perfect angle
11/28/19, 21:29 - Sara: Because there are many

11/28/19, 21:40 - Sara: Obviously
11/28/19, 21:40 - Sara: But maybe it is weird for the pther partner
11/28/19, 21:40 - Sara: Hahha

11/28/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad but not very eventful
11/28/19, 23:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tomorrow is important
11/28/19, 23:01 - Sara: Productive at least?
11/28/19, 23:01 - Sara: Meeting right?
11/28/19, 23:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will meet my promoter and after that I should know everything to finish the thesis
11/28/19, 23:02 - Sara: Yasss
11/28/19, 23:02 - Sara: Good luck :B
11/28/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: So if you feel like, we can talk until around 12, 12:30 I think
11/28/19, 23:05 - Sara: Okay
11/28/19, 23:05 - Sara: I finish the chapter and I call you
11/28/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👏🍑
11/28/19, 23:05 - Sara: Xddd
11/29/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I don't enjoy discussing the sex experimentation topic is because it's not really what I'm interested in in the first place. I told you that I enjoy cuddling more than sex, I am curious about some things and I am willing to experiment, of course, but it never was and never will be a priority and I suppose I don't like that much focusing on that.
11/29/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also it's something that we used to do quite a bit before the break up so that's also not helping, sorry
11/29/19, 00:50 - Sara: What do you refer?
11/29/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Discussing sex, doing tests about it, that sort of thing
11/29/19, 00:51 - Sara: I didn’t know that
11/29/19, 00:51 - Sara: Sorry
11/29/19, 00:51 - Sara: Just I wanted to give my opinion but I accept yours
11/29/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, I'm fine and there isn't any problem
11/29/19, 00:52 - Sara: Sure?
11/29/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think that maybe now is not the time yet for these discussions, I guess
11/29/19, 00:52 - Sara: Sorry
11/29/19, 00:52 - Sara: I feel horrible
11/29/19, 00:52 - Sara: I just did it with my best intentions
11/29/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry, once again, it's not a problem, I know that you are interested in that and you even want to work in something related to that topic and I respect that
11/29/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: So seriously l, no harm done
11/29/19, 00:54 - Sara: Sorry for making you uncomfortable 😣😣
11/29/19, 00:54 - Sara: I probably felt judged
11/29/19, 00:54 - Sara: Or disliked, seen as a weirdo
11/29/19, 00:54 - Sara: It is about what or i don’t do with you
11/29/19, 00:55 - Sara: Maybe too excited in a topic you don’t care
11/29/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry that it looked like that, I didn't mean anything like that
11/29/19, 00:55 - Sara: It is when you talk about something that makes you  happy
11/29/19, 00:56 - Sara: Not me doing stuff with  (I guess I can try stuff on my own)
11/29/19, 00:56 - Sara: You*
11/29/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do care, it's not like I have no interest at all, it's just maybe too early for that, sorry
11/29/19, 00:56 - Sara: Sorry
11/29/19, 00:56 - Sara: I didn’t know that
11/29/19, 00:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't hold any grudge for that, don't worry
11/29/19, 00:57 - Sara: Sorry if I overwhelmed you
11/29/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll be happy to try things with you, it might not be my main interest but I want to share yours, be a part of your life
11/29/19, 00:58 - Sara: Just tell me when you are not comfortable with something please
11/29/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, sorry for my lack of communication, but really, no harm done
11/29/19, 00:59 - Sara: No, i won’t force you after knowng this
11/29/19, 00:59 - Sara: Sorry for mine, it was my fault
11/29/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course you won't force me, and neither will I, I genuinely want to
11/29/19, 01:00 - Sara: We will see
11/29/19, 01:00 - Sara: As you said
11/29/19, 01:00 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/29/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Always ❤️
11/29/19, 01:00 - Sara: So do I
11/29/19, 01:00 - Sara: 💋
11/29/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: As was said before, we can at least try to see if it's anything interesting
11/29/19, 01:02 - Sara: Do not worry
11/29/19, 01:02 - Sara: It is okay :)
11/29/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I obviously don't want this to be an important part of our relationship, just an addition to make it better, not a necessity
11/29/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I suppose you share that feeling
11/29/19, 01:03 - Sara: Of course it is not the pilar
11/29/19, 01:05 - Sara: Sorry If I gave that impression
11/29/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, not really, as I said, I think that you share my idea about this
11/29/19, 01:06 - Sara: Yes
11/29/19, 01:06 - Sara: But I overwhelmed you all of a sudden
11/29/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it is something you're quite passionate about, next time I will overwhelm you with Rockets xd
11/29/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
11/29/19, 01:09 - Sara: ~ljubljana~
11/29/19, 01:09 - Sara: But I love you talk to me about what you like
11/29/19, 01:09 - Sara: It is good to learn
11/29/19, 01:09 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/29/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know and I really want to learn from you about your interests too, please, don't think that I don't, but in this case there is also that issue I mentioned before
11/29/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I need more time, it's a process, but I think it's going in a good direction
11/29/19, 01:11 - Sara: I know
11/29/19, 01:11 - Sara: Sorry for that
11/29/19, 01:12 - Sara: I should not take things for granted
11/29/19, 01:12 - Sara: I respect it and I want to help
11/29/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: A hug at the airport will be a good start 💕
11/29/19, 01:13 - Sara: Of course ❤
11/29/19, 01:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>

11/29/19, 01:19 - Sara: The same 💋
11/29/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: In 7 days I will be in an Arab bath and hopefully I will die there, happy as hell ❤️

11/29/19, 10:53 - Sara: Damn, there was yesterday satanic seminars in my faculta and lmao what happened
11/29/19, 10:53 - Sara: Idk what you think about satanism xD
11/29/19, 11:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: If they are serious about it, than I obviously don't like it, like any other religion, if it's more like ironic, like for example there is a church of Satan on Twitter, I think, then it's cool
11/29/19, 11:27 - Sara: It is like that
11/29/19, 11:27 - Sara: All of them are atheist or agnostic
11/29/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, then I like them ❤️
11/29/19, 11:27 - Sara: But they use satan as an archetypical figure againts hierarchy
11/29/19, 11:27 - Sara: So that is cool
11/29/19, 11:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yeah, in that way, I like it a lot
11/29/19, 11:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I wouldn't really call it Satanism, tbh
11/29/19, 11:29 - Sara: Well, they explain it in an interview
11/29/19, 11:29 - Sara: It is in Spanish but I can send some pieces of news
11/29/19, 11:29 - Sara: Now my mind wants to do research about this
11/29/19, 11:29 - Sara: and sex xD
11/29/19, 11:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sex and Satan xd

11/30/19, 01:40 - Sara: 👌🏻
11/30/19, 01:41 - Sara: The bi meeting was interesting. I was afraid of Raul feeling excluded or not interested, but he liked discussing about topics concerning bisexuality

11/30/19, 01:47 - Sara: Any plans for tomorrow?
11/30/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, mostly the thesis, I think I finally know all I need and I want to focus on that so that I can send an almost finished version to my promoter before going to Spain
11/30/19, 01:48 - Sara: 😎
11/30/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I will tell you if and when I'll be alone tomorrow

11/30/19, 02:00 - Sara: And people have told me about places to recite poetry. I hope i can have enough material soon 💕
11/30/19, 02:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me das mucho miedo, es verdad 😱

11/30/19, 02:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
11/30/19, 02:01 - Sara: Sure. Tomorrow I’ll revise it and probably i’d change something ^^
11/30/19, 02:02 - Sara: Supe que ese era el día.
Tenía que hacer las maletas e irme.
Corrí lo más veloz posible
y no eché la vista hacia atrás.
Era mi deber.

Iba sin destino.
Sin dinero en la cartera. 
Ni tiempo, ni rumbo,
ni ganas de pensar qué
es lo que está bien.
Qué es lo que había hecho mal.

Mi cabeza, un invernadero,
donde yacía el cuerpo sin vida
de la que un día fui.
Era el festín de los gusanos y 
el manjar de otro cadaver.
Era el horrible lugar 
dónde crecía
una hermosa flor.
Era un girasol.

Los rayos de luz me hablaban 
y me susurraban que siguiera
todo recto y hacia delante.
Tenía claro que 
no tengo camino ni hogar,
no pertenezco a ningún lugar.
No soy de las manos que me someten
aunque me quieran amar.

Que lo poco que llevo
en esta pesada mochila
- con bolsillos escondidos
y muchas cremalleras -
me sirva para ver 
que no hay máscara ni miedo,
ni desamor ni falta de razón
que puedan aferrarse 
a esta carne viva
que en vida decidió morir.
- y ahora ya no.
11/30/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't understand it completely but I think I get the main point
11/30/19, 02:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish...
11/30/19, 02:04 - Sara: Maybe it is a little bit hard
11/30/19, 02:04 - Sara: You are on time to change it hahaha
11/30/19, 02:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I spent too much time learning it to just abandon it at this point xd
11/30/19, 02:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it seems useful so I definitely want to know it fluently
11/30/19, 02:06 - Sara: Xdddd

11/30/19, 21:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Forget everything I just said
11/30/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: xd
11/30/19, 21:45 - Sara: Xdd
11/30/19, 21:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, ok, remember it again
11/30/19, 21:46 - Sara: Sorry
11/30/19, 21:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UgjyL4d1g
11/30/19, 21:46 - Sara: Yasss
11/30/19, 21:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: come on, I'm not serious, by now I think you know that I don;t have any problems with the way a body functions xd
11/30/19, 21:47 - Sara: I mean to this
11/30/19, 21:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that I like the photo and you can remember all the nice things I said again ❤
11/30/19, 21:48 - Sara: Thanks
11/30/19, 21:48 - Sara: But even if I look like this?
11/30/19, 21:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Look like what? I told you, I like you, deal with it 😈
11/30/19, 21:49 - Sara: Hahahaha
11/30/19, 21:49 - Sara: Cute
11/30/19, 21:49 - Sara: I don’t know
11/30/19, 21:49 - Sara: I’m thinking that also by doing this cybersex stuff I have to be aware if me and my body look nice
11/30/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: but why? I only want this to be at least a bit enjoyable and you seemed to like it at the beginning, for me it's not really that different than the real sex
11/30/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: approach is the same, the way I see you is also not different
11/30/19, 21:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: if anything, in person I see more
11/30/19, 21:51 - Sara: Because I’m silly 🤣🤦🏽‍♀
11/30/19, 21:52 - Sara: Of course
11/30/19, 21:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: well, you can probably try to turn off the view from your camera so that you only see me, I guess?
11/30/19, 21:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know that seeing myself on the screen is a bit distracting for me
11/30/19, 21:53 - Sara: But I have to know how I look for you
11/30/19, 21:53 - Sara: I think the same
11/30/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: always great 💋
11/30/19, 21:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: but seriously, I can just tell you to move the camera if necessary
11/30/19, 21:53 - Sara: I suppose
11/30/19, 21:54 - Sara: But I have to look good and I need to see myself for that
11/30/19, 21:54 - Sara: Right?
11/30/19, 21:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: or maybe you can just listen to my opinion? I mean you say that you want to look good for me so my opinion is the most important one in that case, no?
11/30/19, 21:55 - Sara: Yes, sorry
11/30/19, 21:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: don't worry about it, it's a bit silly
11/30/19, 21:57 - Sara: I’m look too submissive, i don’t recognise myself xD
11/30/19, 21:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: if we ever try this again I think it's reasonable to turn off the view from your own camera, I will surely do that because it is quite distracting and I think it would be better without that
11/30/19, 21:59 - Sara: True, maybe it is that
11/30/19, 21:59 - Sara: But what if I don’t look erotic?
11/30/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will tell you all you need to know 💋
11/30/19, 22:00 - Sara: Okay
11/30/19, 22:00 - Sara: I’m a slave of my own body, it sucks af
11/30/19, 22:01 - Sara: I have to leave
11/30/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean during normal sex I also don't look at myself, if I did I would probably have some issues too so it only makes sense to do the same with cybersex
11/30/19, 22:01 - Sara: Talk to you later? 💋
11/30/19, 22:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: sure, whenever you want ❤
11/30/19, 22:01 - Sara: As well
11/30/19, 22:01 - Sara: Thats for enduring me xd
11/30/19, 22:02 - Sara: Sometimes I can be so negative
11/30/19, 22:02 - Sara: I’m not like this
11/30/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, don't worry
11/30/19, 22:05 - Sara: Thanks
11/30/19, 22:06 - Sara: Idk, it is as if people would dislike me if i commit a mistake

12/1/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: You don't love your ass so you don't deserve it 😾
12/1/19, 19:06 - Sara: Do you want it as a souvenir?
12/1/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would it be similar to that? It may be a bit awkward at the airport but sure, why not
12/1/19, 19:10 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
12/1/19, 19:10 - Sara: Mine does not vibrate :(

12/1/19, 19:18 - Sara: Next time ;)
12/1/19, 19:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know that much about ass but I don't think it should wiggle side to side so that's probably good
12/1/19, 19:21 - Sara: Wait
12/1/19, 19:21 - Sara: Mmmm

12/6/19, 07:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why would you have it?
12/6/19, 07:47 - Sara: Ricardo has it and by accident I took his glasses
12/6/19, 07:47 - Sara: But I don’t feel anything
12/6/19, 07:47 - Sara: So that is nice
12/6/19, 07:48 - Sara: How is it going?
12/6/19, 07:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still in the bus, I'll arrive at the airport around 9:30
12/6/19, 07:48 - Sara: Okay
12/6/19, 07:48 - Sara: Are you not going to sleep?
12/6/19, 07:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm trying a bit but it's not so easy
12/6/19, 07:49 - Sara: Poor Kamil
12/6/19, 07:49 - Sara: It is okay, soon you’ll get it
12/6/19, 07:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: How did your meeting go?
12/6/19, 07:50 - Sara: It was nice! I tell you later
12/6/19, 07:50 - Sara: I’ll do uni stuff ^^
12/6/19, 07:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'll tell you when I arrive at the airport
12/6/19, 07:51 - Sara: Perfect 💗
12/6/19, 07:51 - Sara: 😊😊
12/6/19, 09:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm at the airport and I got past the security check
12/6/19, 09:50 - Sara: Niceee
12/6/19, 09:50 - Sara: What are you going to do?
12/6/19, 09:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I'll read something, fortunately I don't have to wait so long
12/6/19, 09:52 - Sara: It is not at 11:30?
12/6/19, 09:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/6/19, 09:53 - Sara: One hour and a half haha
12/6/19, 09:53 - Sara: You have time to watch a film xD
12/6/19, 09:54 - Sara: Maybe I can tell you and you get distracted haha
12/6/19, 09:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure, why not

12/6/19, 10:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 10:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: If he acted that way than I suppose you're better off without him in your life anyway, I guess
12/6/19, 10:09 - Sara: Yes, true
12/6/19, 10:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's nice that Ricardo is handling it more maturely
12/6/19, 10:09 - Sara: As well, i’m happy he is like that
12/6/19, 10:09 - Sara: I see the difference between him and Jose xd
12/6/19, 10:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: So close 😱😱😱
12/6/19, 10:10 - Sara: Yasss

12/6/19, 10:12 - Sara: How much did you sleep?
12/6/19, 10:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Total, at night and in the bus, maybe around 3 hours
12/6/19, 10:13 - Sara: Aw babe :(
12/6/19, 10:13 - Sara: I hope in the plane you can sleep
12/6/19, 10:13 - Sara: And you will travel faster :p
12/6/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/6/19, 10:16 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 10:16 - Sara: :)
12/6/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously, this week will be a throwback to our best moments
12/6/19, 10:17 - Sara: True
12/6/19, 10:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mentioned that you have a shower, right? Xd
12/6/19, 10:17 - Sara: But I prefer creating new ones :)
12/6/19, 10:17 - Sara: NoOoooOoooOoO
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: Obviously
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: ahahahha
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: But not for puking
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: Never again
12/6/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😥
12/6/19, 10:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ruined
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: C:
12/6/19, 10:18 - Sara: Because you didn’t clean it
12/6/19, 10:19 - Sara: XD
12/6/19, 10:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would have after I recovered but you did it faster xd
12/6/19, 10:20 - Sara: I didn’t have to recover for anything hahah :p
12/6/19, 10:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 10:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was kind of nice afterwards though xd
12/6/19, 10:23 - Sara: 💗
12/6/19, 10:23 - Sara: Definitely
12/6/19, 10:24 - Sara: I asked Cristina about how she is with me now
12/6/19, 10:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
12/6/19, 10:25 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 10:25 - Sara: And you train haha
12/6/19, 10:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you're talking but you're not talking
12/6/19, 10:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it does sound like her xd
12/6/19, 10:27 - Sara: I didn’t understand that
12/6/19, 10:27 - Sara: And she did not replied
12/6/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that also sound just like her 🤔
12/6/19, 10:28 - Sara: What do you think?
12/6/19, 10:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue, tbh
12/6/19, 10:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wouldn't get my hopes up, if I were you, I guess
12/6/19, 10:29 - Sara: No, of course
12/6/19, 10:29 - Sara: I just asked because we are (were?) talking a lot
12/6/19, 10:30 - Sara: About her life, but talking
12/6/19, 10:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that, which makes her response even weirder
12/6/19, 10:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: But well, in the last months in Ghent I stopped understanding pretty much anything she said so that's still the same
12/6/19, 10:31 - Sara: Yes
12/6/19, 10:32 - Sara: Dime más
12/6/19, 10:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I mean, she was angry at me and you, that was understandable, but she was just unnecessarily rude with most of the people and was just saying some completely random stuff without any sense
12/6/19, 10:33 - Sara: True
12/6/19, 10:33 - Sara: She was tired of being there
12/6/19, 10:33 - Sara: And of people probably
12/6/19, 10:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps
12/6/19, 10:34 - Sara: She told me so
12/6/19, 10:35 - Sara: At least about leaving Ghent
12/6/19, 10:35 - Sara: That people were horrible and this stuff
12/6/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if she thinks so, that's her right
12/6/19, 10:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whatever, enough about her
12/6/19, 10:36 - Sara: Of course
12/6/19, 10:36 - Sara: But her influence...
12/6/19, 10:36 - Sara: Idk if it is still there in me
12/6/19, 10:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Was it good or bad?
12/6/19, 10:37 - Sara: That is what I’m trying to answer
12/6/19, 10:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anyway, so do we have any plans besides the Arab bath for today?
12/6/19, 10:39 - Sara: Mmmm nop, really
12/6/19, 10:39 - Sara: Sex shop? 🌝
12/6/19, 10:40 - Sara: Hahaha nah, probably you’ll want to sleep a bit
12/6/19, 10:40 - Sara: If not, having a walk and go to the city centre
12/6/19, 10:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I suppose it's best to think about it after we arrive in your apartment
12/6/19, 10:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that seems fine
12/6/19, 10:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or this too, or both xd
12/6/19, 10:41 - Sara: True :)
12/6/19, 10:41 - Sara: Options are there ^^
12/6/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: My flight is delayed 😭
12/6/19, 10:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know yet how much
12/6/19, 10:43 - Sara: Really? It is okay, do not worry ^^
12/6/19, 10:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ehhh, 1 hour delay 😒
12/6/19, 10:59 - Sara: Not that much :)
12/6/19, 11:00 - Sara: Don’t worry 💕
12/6/19, 11:01 - Sara: Are you okay?
12/6/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, just annoyed
12/6/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: And a bit hungry
12/6/19, 11:02 - Sara: don't be bad, it is not your fult
12/6/19, 11:02 - Sara: fault*
12/6/19, 11:02 - Sara: I know that it sucks but there is nothing you can do
12/6/19, 11:02 - Sara: More time to eat :)
12/6/19, 11:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not bad, just angry
12/6/19, 11:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But airport food is shit and it's expensive 😩
12/6/19, 11:03 - Sara: Did you bring something from home?
12/6/19, 11:03 - Sara: Maybe later we can call each other for one hour :)
12/6/19, 11:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, no room for anything more in my bag xd
12/6/19, 11:04 - Sara: Is it full?
12/6/19, 11:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Very xd
12/6/19, 11:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just got a free candy 😊
12/6/19, 11:04 - Sara: Oh, poor boy

12/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: I don't know its name
12/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: COP25 reunion
12/6/19, 11:11 - Sara: Greta Thunberg is here xd
12/6/19, 11:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok

12/6/19, 11:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess we'll manage somehow, I hope
12/6/19, 11:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cuenca won't be crowded xd
12/6/19, 11:12 - Sara: Yes, I'm used to Madrid
12/6/19, 11:12 - Sara: xddd

12/6/19, 11:12 - Sara: And Toledo a little bit
12/6/19, 11:13 - Sara: Btw, are you flying finally at 12:30?
12/6/19, 11:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that, not sure, I'll tell you when I board
12/6/19, 11:14 - Sara: okay ❤
12/6/19, 11:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is 'bildungsroman'?
12/6/19, 11:14 - Sara: Oh xD
12/6/19, 11:14 - Sara: A type of novel which is based on the main character's personal development
12/6/19, 11:14 - Sara: mainly, it is about maturation
12/6/19, 11:17 - Sara: Thanks for reading it
12/6/19, 11:17 - Sara: It is true that i'm changing it now
12/6/19, 11:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: With the way Esther thinks about the people around her reminds me a bit of Cristina now
12/6/19, 11:23 - Sara: xddddd
12/6/19, 11:23 - Sara: So bad
12/6/19, 11:23 - Sara: I hope they won't end up the same xD
12/6/19, 11:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why you show the alienation theories in order 1,2,4,3?
12/6/19, 11:39 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/6/19, 11:40 - Sara: Like each of them?
12/6/19, 11:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mention alienation theories, you write first, second, fourth and at the end you mention third
12/6/19, 11:40 - Sara: Yep, true
12/6/19, 11:40 - Sara: I changed the position of the last one
12/6/19, 11:41 - Sara: But anyway i’ll check how I enumerate them
12/6/19, 11:41 - Sara: Good to know ^^
12/6/19, 11:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, the content seems good, interesting to read and factually I don't see problems but stylistically and grammatically I would make plenty of improvements
12/6/19, 11:43 - Sara: In the way of writting you mean?
12/6/19, 11:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you give me a computer I can later mark what I think could be changed
12/6/19, 11:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some errors and some things that just don't sound very English to me
12/6/19, 11:44 - Sara: I changed the mistakes
12/6/19, 11:44 - Sara: Okay
12/6/19, 11:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'll take a look at the new version then
12/6/19, 11:44 - Sara: Yep
12/6/19, 11:44 - Sara: I’ll try do the draft
12/6/19, 11:45 - Sara: Thanks for reading it :)
12/6/19, 11:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: De nada 😊
12/6/19, 12:06 - Sara: 💋
12/6/19, 12:06 - Sara: What are you going?

12/6/19, 12:07 - Sara: Nice 💕
12/6/19, 13:00 - Sara: Are you on the plane? Yes, right?
12/6/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 13:00 - Sara: 👍
12/6/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope that in around 10 minutes we'll take off
12/6/19, 13:00 - Sara: Okay
12/6/19, 13:01 - Sara: So around 5 you will be available right? ^^

12/6/19, 13:02 - Sara: 👍
12/6/19, 13:03 - Sara: Excellent ^^
12/6/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fucking frenchies are on strike and apparently now we still have to wait another 35 minutes 😡
12/6/19, 13:31 - Sara: True
12/6/19, 13:31 - Sara: My mother told me
12/6/19, 13:31 - Sara: Do not worry 💕
12/6/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: If we have another more delay I will explode xd
12/6/19, 13:32 - Sara: Do not worry babe :)
12/6/19, 13:33 - Sara: It will be okay
12/6/19, 13:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm hungry as hell and now I have to sit in this shitty plane 😣
12/6/19, 13:33 - Sara: You haven’t eaten anything? :((((
12/6/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
12/6/19, 13:34 - Sara: Why? :(
12/6/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I was hoping to have lunch in Madrid but of course the delay happened
12/6/19, 13:35 - Sara: What would you feel like eating?
12/6/19, 13:35 - Sara: Do not worry
12/6/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Food
12/6/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anything
12/6/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~You~

12/6/19, 17:41 - Sara: I’m nervious af
12/6/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: You were waiting since 16?
12/6/19, 17:42 - Sara: 🤔
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: 3 hours-flight, you told me your flight started at 1
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: So.... probably
12/6/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I told you that there was another delay
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: Yes
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: 35 minutes
12/6/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it started around two xd
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: Yo told me that at 12:30
12/6/19, 17:43 - Sara: You didn’t tell me...
12/6/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Really? Sorry, I thought I did, perdóname 🙏
12/6/19, 17:44 - Sara: It is okay
12/6/19, 17:44 - Sara: Well, miscalculation I guess
12/6/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I see that I told you that 13:30
12/6/19, 17:45 - Sara: Well
12/6/19, 17:45 - Sara: I’m too excited to care

12/13/19, 12:03 - Sara: You
12/13/19, 12:03 - Sara: But yes, I would like to see it ❤
12/13/19, 12:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you can either fly directly to Cracovia or to Warsaw and take a train from there, whatever would be cheaper
12/13/19, 12:05 - Sara: okay ❤

12/13/19, 12:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 12:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll have to see later as well because most likely I'll start working by the end of January so a bit hard to say
12/13/19, 12:16 - Sara: really? What have you seen?
12/13/19, 12:16 - Sara: I'll check as well april
12/13/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I haven't checked exactly yet so I don't know anything for sure
12/13/19, 12:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably at the beginning of January it will be clearer
12/13/19, 12:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, first the thesis, then I'll figure out the rest of my life, I guess
12/13/19, 12:19 - Sara: okay!

12/13/19, 12:20 - Sara: My father has just asked if you already arrived ^^

12/13/19, 12:45 - Sara: Okaaay
12/13/19, 12:45 - Sara: Which ones do you know?
12/13/19, 12:45 - Sara: Want*
12/13/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Spain~ I don't know, at least at the moment my best choice for going abroad would be the Erasmus internship so realistically, whatever is available
12/13/19, 12:46 - Sara: And me visiting you :B
12/13/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí 💋

12/13/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, whatever is available, at least now I don't think I have the luxury of choosing the place
12/13/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll check it again when I arrive, there are probably some new offers
12/13/19, 12:49 - Sara: Coool
12/13/19, 12:49 - Sara: Cross fingers :P
12/13/19, 12:50 - Sara: How is your journey going?
12/13/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: We arrived in the center of Warsaw
12/13/19, 12:51 - Sara: Nice! I’m in the apartment again
12/13/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Next stop is I think the other airport and then finally to lodz
12/13/19, 12:51 - Sara: How long?
12/13/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: 3 and a half hour, more or less
12/13/19, 12:52 - Sara: Are you okay?
12/13/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: The airport I arrived in is a bit far from the city unfortunately
12/13/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, most of the people left the bus in the center so there is a lot of space now
12/13/19, 12:53 - Sara: Cool
12/13/19, 12:53 - Sara: And your health?
12/13/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Still breathing xd
12/13/19, 12:54 - Sara: :(
12/13/19, 12:54 - Sara: :,(
12/13/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I'm dissapointed too, I was hoping to die in Spain
12/13/19, 12:56 - Sara: And your ghost living in my room?
12/13/19, 12:56 - Sara: No thanks xd
12/13/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Always with you, FOREVEEER
12/13/19, 12:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😘
12/13/19, 12:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you liked Ghost 🤔
12/13/19, 12:58 - Sara: I like ghost
12/13/19, 12:58 - Sara: Not your ghost :p

12/13/19, 13:27 - Sara: 💋
12/13/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Say hola to your tetas, and tell them I miss them 💋
12/13/19, 13:40 - Sara: Say hola as well to your pelotas and tell them to get well soon
12/13/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: They are already fine, but they appreciate the concern ❤️

12/13/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: And my brother will pick me up from the station
12/13/19, 13:44 - Sara: Nice 💕

12/13/19, 16:45 - Sara: Great! How was it?
12/13/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, no delays, I didn't need to wait for anything too long
12/13/19, 16:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: But quite tiring, I will eat something and probably take a nap
12/13/19, 16:56 - Sara: Nice 💕
12/13/19, 16:56 - Sara: Glad that you arrives safely at home
12/13/19, 16:56 - Sara: 💋
12/13/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you, love?
12/13/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I saw the posts on Instagram ❤️❤️❤️
12/13/19, 16:57 - Sara: What do you think?

12/13/19, 17:04 - Sara: Hahahaha

12/13/19, 17:05 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, nothing, just noticed that there are plenty of photos like that 😂💋💋💋
12/13/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm happy that your pussy is no longer radioactive 😊
12/13/19, 17:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you need to talk about those feelings of substitution? I'm here for you ❤️
12/13/19, 17:11 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHA you didn’t noticed :p
12/13/19, 17:11 - Sara: I love them anyway 😍
12/13/19, 17:12 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's possible that it's difficult for him, I think we've discussed it before, also he's probably spending more time with Raquel now so that also contributes to that. As for why he treated you differently than her, well, I don't know the details but I guess maybe he learned to be better than he used to be or maybe she just demands more effort from him than you did
12/13/19, 17:17 - Sara: As well
12/13/19, 17:17 - Sara: It is about getting used to I guess
12/13/19, 17:18 - Sara: Sometimes I’m better without knowing about him, and that is sad
12/13/19, 17:19 - Sara: I’m also spending more time with you, and that is not bad neither
12/13/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree ❤️
12/13/19, 17:20 - Sara: 💕
12/13/19, 17:20 - Sara: We deserve to build our lives again
12/13/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 18:24 - Sara: Who is the seal? 💕
12/13/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was asking myself the same question 🤔
12/13/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
12/13/19, 18:25 - Sara: Both of us ❤
12/13/19, 18:25 - Sara: Have you slept?
12/13/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet, I wanted to but then after all I didn't feel like yet
12/13/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably soon
12/13/19, 18:26 - Sara: The same
12/13/19, 18:27 - Sara: 😴
12/13/19, 18:27 - Sara: I haven’t stopped until now haha

12/13/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you have an editable version of your essay?
12/13/19, 23:30 - Sara: Yep! I can create a word
12/13/19, 23:30 - Sara: Wait a second
12/13/19, 23:30 - Sara: Are you okay? ^^
12/13/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I had some medicine and a nice nap and I feel better
12/13/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Qué tal, muchacha?
12/13/19, 23:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 23:37 - Sara: Great! How was the come back?
12/13/19, 23:37 - Sara: I'm good! We went Melo, Elisa and me to a feminista place to eat and play bingo hahaha
12/13/19, 23:38 - Sara: what about you?
12/13/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nooo, I already knew what is Melo, who is Melo and why is Melo, now I wanted to see how is Melo #llorando 😥
12/13/19, 23:39 - Sara: XDDDD
12/13/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, just napping and resting
12/13/19, 23:40 - Sara: Nice ❤
12/13/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: and you are already back? So early?
12/13/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Borracha xd
12/13/19, 23:42 - Sara: Yep, we went around 8
12/13/19, 23:42 - Sara: And also they prefer being home soon xD
12/13/19, 23:42 - Sara: I didm't drink shots xd
12/13/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: it was great because in a matter of more or less an hour you transitioned from saying that you're absolutely not drunk to admitting that you are quite drunk xd
12/13/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara se emborracha mucho xd
12/13/19, 23:44 - Sara: That is how alcohol affects xd
12/13/19, 23:44 - Sara: HAHAHA no mucho
12/13/19, 23:44 - Sara: Have you hear the voice messages?
12/13/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: not yet, I was busy sleeping, I'll take a look at your essay now and I'll listen to them tomorrow
12/13/19, 23:46 - Sara: Nice :B
12/13/19, 23:46 - Sara: Thanks :D
12/13/19, 23:46 - Sara: Love you
12/13/19, 23:46 - Sara: Btw, could we later or these days talk about our relation? ^^
12/13/19, 23:46 - Sara: Just to clarofy things, nothing else ^^
12/13/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, whenever you have time
12/13/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~I know~ I love you more ♥️
12/13/19, 23:47 - Sara: 💋💋💋
12/13/19, 23:47 - Sara: 😍
12/13/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: So last days was your time and now is your sister's turn to make 'ruído'? Xd
12/13/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough 😋
12/14/19, 00:03 - Sara: Sure hahaha
12/14/19, 00:03 - Sara: That happened before xD
12/14/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gr63DiEUxw
12/14/19, 00:12 - Sara: What do you mean? :)
12/14/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just wanna be
Wanna bewitch you in the moonlight
Just wanna be
I wanna bewitch you all night
12/14/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm going through the whole set list now ❤
12/14/19, 00:13 - Sara: Awww
12/14/19, 00:13 - Sara: You tel me :B
12/14/19, 00:28 - Sara: I have just bought the meet and greet for the concert 💕
12/14/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: When is it going to be?
12/14/19, 00:29 - Sara: 7th of March
12/14/19, 00:30 - Sara: and the 21st, Myrath ❤ ❤
12/14/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Puffff, long term plans 😋
12/14/19, 00:31 - Sara: But great plans ❤ ❤
12/14/19, 00:31 - Sara: How is it going?
12/14/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm reading the essay a bit but I'm a bit tired so I'll probably finish it tomorrow
12/14/19, 00:31 - Sara: Do not worry :)
12/14/19, 00:31 - Sara: Going to sleep?
12/14/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not yet but probably soon, traveling is quite tiring
12/14/19, 00:32 - Sara: Of course
12/14/19, 00:32 - Sara: What else have you done?
12/14/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Took a long nap xd
12/14/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm a bit useless today, but I'll recover 😊
12/14/19, 00:33 - Sara: Do not say thaaaat
12/14/19, 00:34 - Sara: But you reserve to sleep :)
12/14/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: But my bed is so empty 😢
12/14/19, 00:34 - Sara: Mine too :(
12/14/19, 00:34 - Sara: So sad
12/14/19, 00:35 - Sara: But soon ❤
12/14/19, 00:36 - Sara: How do you feel?
12/14/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, physically tired but overall a bit better, less sick, mentally, happy because of the trip and sad because I had to leave 💋
12/14/19, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/14/19, 00:37 - Sara: In general?
12/14/19, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: However you want
12/14/19, 00:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 00:39 - Sara: Well, I'm tired, first of all. And then, I'm happy for us, but it is true that stabilising us as a couple is about time
12/14/19, 00:40 - Sara: I think it is also not being afraid of the future, I should trust in it more
12/14/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we have a lot of time ahead of us so I suppose there is no reason to be afraid, one way or another it will be fine
12/14/19, 00:42 - Sara: ❤
12/14/19, 00:42 - Sara: If we help each other I'm sure we will be great
12/14/19, 00:42 - Sara: I'm here for you :)
12/14/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, sadly, 'here' is in Spain and for me in Poland 😥
12/14/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: But hopefully that situation can be improved, I'll for sure have it in mind
12/14/19, 00:44 - Sara: But support is there
12/14/19, 00:44 - Sara: At least I feel it, although distance can be hard
12/14/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, but I also want to support you with aggressive forehead kisses 😘
12/14/19, 00:45 - Sara: 🥰🥰🥰💋💋💋💋
12/14/19, 00:45 - Sara: Love you
12/14/19, 00:46 - Sara: I'm already alone in my room
12/14/19, 00:46 - Sara: Probably I'll hear ruidos soon xD
12/14/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: they should have done this earlier, we could have had a competition, who is louder xd
12/14/19, 00:47 - Sara: ahahahahhaha
12/14/19, 00:47 - Sara: Imagine HAHAHAH
12/14/19, 00:47 - Sara: And you'l become an animal :P
12/14/19, 00:47 - Sara: You are a pupy in bed ❤
12/14/19, 00:48 - Sara: puppy
12/14/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I didn't bite you too much this time because you prefered being spanked xd
12/14/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: WHICH IS A PUNISHMENT, STOP ENJOYING IT
12/14/19, 00:48 - Sara: You liked it as well xD
12/14/19, 00:48 - Sara: STOP DOING IT WHEN I'M NAKED
12/14/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'M DOING IT ALL THE TIME, NOT ONLY WHEN YOU ARE NAKED
12/14/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: also not my fault that you are naked a lot xd
12/14/19, 00:50 - Sara: Because you don’t like it 🌝
12/14/19, 00:50 - Sara: Please, can we fill soon the contract? Haha
12/14/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't say that
12/14/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is there an online sex version?
12/14/19, 00:51 - Sara: I’m sure
12/14/19, 00:51 - Sara: Let me check
12/14/19, 00:53 - Sara: I don’t like them :c
12/14/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll figure out my life and hopefully online won't be necessary anymore 💋
12/14/19, 00:54 - Sara: :p
12/14/19, 00:54 - Sara: Don’t be in a rush :p
12/14/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if not Spain then maybe at least a country more accessible than Poland xd
12/14/19, 00:57 - Sara: It could be nice
12/14/19, 00:57 - Sara: Btw
12/14/19, 00:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where do you have good connections by plane?
12/14/19, 00:57 - Sara: Maybe we experienced it in Ghent
12/14/19, 00:57 - Sara: But how was your experience living with me?
12/14/19, 00:57 - Sara: But I can also be closer to Poland
12/14/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: You mean in one city?
12/14/19, 00:58 - Sara: Mmmm... Portugal, France, Belgium, Germany xd
12/14/19, 00:58 - Sara: Yep, sharing house...
12/14/19, 00:58 - Sara: But idk what i’m going to do with my lifr xd
12/14/19, 00:58 - Sara: Life*
12/14/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for now you still have your degree to finish and I'm almost done with mine and perhaps I can have some interesting options
12/14/19, 00:59 - Sara: Missed voice call
12/14/19, 00:59 - Sara: Sooorry
12/14/19, 00:59 - Sara: Tell me ^^
12/14/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's a new experience, living together requires some adjustments but overall I liked it and it felt great knowing that I can see you in person almost anytime I wanted
12/14/19, 01:00 - Sara: As wellq
12/14/19, 01:00 - Sara: Also In Ghent it was nice
12/14/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the moment I'm not sure if I would prefer living in the same apartment or in separate ones that are close to each other, I don't have enough experience with that, but definitely I would want to be in the same city
12/14/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or at least country
12/14/19, 01:03 - Sara: Agree
12/14/19, 01:03 - Sara: Idk i have been thinking that I like having my own space
12/14/19, 01:03 - Sara: Same apartment with different rooms haha
12/14/19, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me too, sometimes I just like to be alone for some time and it has nothing to do with other people, I just need it sometimes
12/14/19, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: But not too much, just from time to tome
12/14/19, 01:04 - Sara: Well, of course
12/14/19, 01:04 - Sara: Who doesn’t?
12/14/19, 01:05 - Sara: I had to say i was afraid os sharing this view
12/14/19, 01:05 - Sara: I mean, about being more independent
12/14/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's important to preserve individuality, spending all the time together is not necessary and probably not even a good idea tbh
12/14/19, 01:06 - Sara: I think the same
12/14/19, 01:07 - Sara: Maybe i have a new conception about couples, and that is what i wanted to share
12/14/19, 01:07 - Sara: That does not mean i don’t care about the others
12/14/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course not, it means that you also care about yourself
12/14/19, 01:09 - Sara: ~Finally~ ~sometimes~
12/14/19, 01:09 - Sara: Like idk, i would like to know more about your approach
12/14/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I definitely want my own space but I also wouldn't mind sharing some things with you, I guess it's about finding the right balance
12/14/19, 01:12 - Sara: Talking in our current situation right?
12/14/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, when it comes to the apartment for example, probably separate rooms, although I wouldn't mind sharing the bed 😊
12/14/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: More in general
12/14/19, 01:13 - Sara: Understandable
12/14/19, 01:13 - Sara: I think the same
12/14/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, over the phone we can probably talk more to make up a bit for the lack of physical contact, I guess
12/14/19, 01:13 - Sara: Possibility of sharing moments amd meetings with the others but not every time
12/14/19, 01:13 - Sara: As well
12/14/19, 01:13 - Sara: As we have done this time right?
12/14/19, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup,  exactly
12/14/19, 01:14 - Sara: I felt comfortable
12/14/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems nice, yes
12/14/19, 01:14 - Sara: For me too
12/14/19, 01:14 - Sara: I’m afraid of being too independent you know?
12/14/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, it's about finding the right balance
12/14/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can share with me however much you want, I'll be happy to hear from you ♥
12/14/19, 01:15 - Sara: Of course 💕
12/14/19, 01:15 - Sara: The same ❤❤❤
12/14/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, for me, making the plans for meeting somewhere in person makes me feel better, just knowing when I'll see you again
12/14/19, 01:16 - Sara: Rt
12/14/19, 01:17 - Sara: That is one of the main features of a long distance relationship
12/14/19, 01:17 - Sara: How important is for you physical contact?
12/14/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's great to have but I can survive without it for some time
12/14/19, 01:18 - Sara: Think the same
12/14/19, 01:18 - Sara: Maybe because it has been today when you left
12/14/19, 01:18 - Sara: But true
12/14/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I enjoy it a lot but it's not the most important thing for me
12/14/19, 01:19 - Sara: I don’t mean sex btw haha
12/14/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I know xd
12/14/19, 01:19 - Sara: Okay just in case
12/14/19, 01:19 - Sara: I’m glad we share these views
12/14/19, 01:20 - Sara: I was a lit afraid of it
12/14/19, 01:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
12/14/19, 01:21 - Sara: Not sharing opinions or relationship views
12/14/19, 01:21 - Sara: Probably
12/14/19, 01:25 - Sara: Something else to add? Probablu i will go to sleep
12/14/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at the moment, we can maybe talk about more later, I'm sleepy too
12/14/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenas noches corazón ♥️♥️♥️
12/14/19, 01:27 - Sara: Hasta mañana 🐻
12/14/19, 01:27 - Sara: 💋
12/14/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, perhaps it is time for you to start seriously studying polish xd
12/14/19, 01:28 - Sara: ~In case I meet your family~
12/14/19, 01:29 - Sara: But it is difficult :(
12/14/19, 01:29 - Sara: I’ll try

12/14/19, 13:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mmmm, I don't remember tbh, do you have recordings or just with a phone?
12/14/19, 14:00 - Sara: Well, i have some recordings I record with my phone
12/14/19, 14:00 - Sara: And then the first instrumental draft that my mates sent
12/14/19, 14:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: How many songs do you have?
12/14/19, 14:06 - Sara: Around 5
12/14/19, 14:06 - Sara: ^^

12/14/19, 14:10 - Sara: Are you going to the dogtor? ;p
12/14/19, 14:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's for bitches
12/14/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll see, for now, I don't think I need to
12/14/19, 14:16 - Sara: 🐶
12/14/19, 14:16 - Sara: That is great 💕
12/14/19, 14:16 - Sara: Any plan for today?
12/14/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, probably just resting, some Netflix or something like that
12/14/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/14/19, 14:17 - Sara: I will work and then go out 😊
12/14/19, 14:18 - Sara: I hope to finish all the assignments this weekend
12/14/19, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, right, I'll continue reading your essay

12/14/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Say hi to your parents 😊
12/14/19, 15:17 - Sara: They are not here yet :(
12/14/19, 15:17 - Sara: Hahaha
12/14/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I should have asked you to say 'hola' ~also to your tetas~ , they don't speak English xd
12/14/19, 16:06 - Sara: As well
12/14/19, 16:06 - Sara: My tits miss you
12/14/19, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, because you don't care about them enough, always making them freeze, muy mal muchacha
12/14/19, 16:15 - Sara: I’m in the no bra club
12/14/19, 16:15 - Sara: And you too
12/14/19, 16:15 - Sara: Be aware of your tits as well
12/14/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am and I care about them because you didn't, mala mujer
12/14/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you doing, amor?
12/14/19, 16:29 - Sara: We were thinking what to wea in thr baptism
12/14/19, 16:29 - Sara: I’ll probably wear a blazer

12/14/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you have one?

12/14/19, 16:31 - Sara: And you will tell me :p
12/14/19, 16:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should've asked the cardinal to baptise the children
12/14/19, 16:33 - Sara: Uy
12/14/19, 16:33 - Sara: Talking about that
12/14/19, 16:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 16:34 - Sara: It exists in Madrid xD
12/14/19, 16:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you didn't take me there, guía horrible 😭
12/14/19, 16:36 - Sara: I knowww
12/14/19, 16:36 - Sara: We could have married there :(
12/14/19, 16:37 - Sara: Btw, i’m going to do uni stuff
12/14/19, 16:37 - Sara: If you have for today the essay read, i’d love you 😘
12/14/19, 16:37 - Sara: But if not it is okay -77
12/14/19, 16:37 - Sara: ^^
12/14/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I was going to do it now
12/14/19, 16:38 - Sara: Thanks babe
12/14/19, 16:38 - Sara: And don’t forget to finish your thesis haha 💗
12/14/19, 16:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: My promoter hasn't responded yet so at least until Monday I have nothing to do with it
12/14/19, 16:39 - Sara: That is weird
12/14/19, 16:39 - Sara: I hope you have the info asap
12/14/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: If he doesn't write me on Monday, I will send him a message so no worries, I won't defend it this month anyway
12/14/19, 16:47 - Sara: Okay
12/14/19, 16:47 - Sara: Time to relax after the trip 💋
12/14/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the trip was rather relaxing too ♥️💋
12/14/19, 16:51 - Sara: ~The Arab baths 💕 ~
12/14/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~You have absolutely no idea how to use the strikethrough xd~
12/14/19, 16:56 - Sara: I know ~asshole~
12/14/19, 16:56 - Sara: HAHAHHAA
12/14/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: 👉🍑?
12/14/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now it's even funnier xd
12/14/19, 16:59 - Sara: Hahahahaha
12/14/19, 16:59 - Sara: Btw, how is the feeling? XD
12/14/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you tell me 😏
12/14/19, 17:04 - Sara: No no
12/14/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
12/14/19, 17:04 - Sara: I asked you ~first~ :0
12/14/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Butt* you're referring to that or something else?
12/14/19, 17:05 - Sara: Xd
12/14/19, 17:05 - Sara: Yes, i’m refering to that
12/14/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it is a bit different, more difficult to enter and feels like the finger is being pushed outside
12/14/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if you were doing that on purpose or if that's just how it works
12/14/19, 17:08 - Sara: Really?
12/14/19, 17:08 - Sara: No, at least intentionally
12/14/19, 17:08 - Sara: ~Neither my asshole likes you~
12/14/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now you xd
12/14/19, 17:09 - Sara: I liked it
12/14/19, 17:09 - Sara: Sense of pooing and pression
12/14/19, 17:09 - Sara: Both haha
12/14/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you can ask Rodrigo for tips about it 😋
12/14/19, 17:10 - Sara: HAHAHAAHA
12/14/19, 17:10 - Sara: That is for sure 😂
12/14/19, 17:10 - Sara: Would it be different? 🤔
12/14/19, 17:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I imagine you probably have some questions, I don't know if you want to explore this topic further or not
12/14/19, 17:12 - Sara: Do you?
12/14/19, 17:12 - Sara: I’m in for everything
12/14/19, 17:12 - Sara: Most xD
12/14/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it's fine either way, when we tried you had some issues so up to you
12/14/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you can learn some practical tips xd
12/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: Sure!
12/14/19, 17:17 - Sara: Well, I guess i didn’t want to bring you chocolate Hahaha
12/14/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess that's why asking the more experienced people can be useful xd
12/14/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: We went to Chueca, we could've asked someone 😊
12/14/19, 17:19 - Sara: Yep!
12/14/19, 17:19 - Sara: To everybody (? Haaha
12/14/19, 17:19 - Sara: How is it going?
12/14/19, 17:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been watching some Ghost videos and I'm also reading your essay
12/14/19, 17:20 - Sara: And how are they?
12/14/19, 17:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, mostly like funny moments from concerts and interviews and I like it a lot ♥️
12/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: Hahahahaa yes, right?
12/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: Please, watch the acoustic version of zombie queen with kazoo
12/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: XD
12/14/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've seen it ♥️❤️♥️❤️
12/14/19, 17:22 - Sara: Amazing HAHAHHAA
12/14/19, 17:23 - Sara: Glad you like them
12/14/19, 17:23 - Sara: And theor acoustics are hugee
12/14/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 18:49 - Sara: Eh
12/14/19, 18:49 - Sara: I read you can use both 🤔
12/14/19, 18:49 - Sara: Oh
12/14/19, 18:49 - Sara: It is misspelled okay haha
12/14/19, 18:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm pretty sure especifically doesn't exist 😘
12/14/19, 18:50 - Sara: :,(
12/14/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
12/14/19, 18:50 - Sara: Oh, you are almost at the end of the essay
12/14/19, 18:50 - Sara: :P
12/14/19, 18:50 - Sara: I’m fine! I studied gender studies and sent an assignment I had
12/14/19, 18:50 - Sara: And you?
12/14/19, 18:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Slowly reading your essay, listening music, watching some videos, overall a pretty lazy day
12/14/19, 18:51 - Sara: That is nice
12/14/19, 18:51 - Sara: You deserve it 👌🏻
12/14/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, after a week with you I need vacations
12/14/19, 18:52 - Sara: They paid you right? 😑
12/14/19, 18:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
12/14/19, 18:52 - Sara: Someone paid you for take care of me xD
12/14/19, 18:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, I had an agreement with Paco
12/14/19, 18:53 - Sara: I knew it!
12/14/19, 18:54 - Sara: I hope it was a lot xD
12/14/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm like a jigolo but instead of fucking for money I offer support for money
12/14/19, 18:55 - Sara: You fucked as well hahaha
12/14/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes but it was gratis
12/14/19, 18:55 - Sara: And even you had to pay for condoms xd
12/14/19, 18:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I charged Paco extra for that
12/14/19, 18:57 - Sara: Oh fair enough
12/14/19, 18:57 - Sara: Paco would be sad if his daughter is pregnant
12/14/19, 18:57 - Sara: :(
12/14/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, I would be sad too, and mom would be sad as well most likely
12/14/19, 18:59 - Sara: Coming to Poland like
12/14/19, 18:59 - Sara: Hey Mum, a baby is coming
12/14/19, 18:59 - Sara: 👶
12/14/19, 19:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: On a more serious note, I watched one video by Pablo on the topic of bilingual children and it got me thinking how that would work
12/14/19, 19:01 - Sara: I read papers in my second year of uni about that
12/14/19, 19:01 - Sara: The topic is really interesting
12/14/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: From the pragmatic perspective it would probably make more sense to teach a child English and Spanish rather than polish probably xd
12/14/19, 19:02 - Sara: Why? More useful?
12/14/19, 19:02 - Sara: Xd
12/14/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Trilingual might be a bit too much
12/14/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But mom would be sad xd
12/14/19, 19:02 - Sara: It is possible as well
12/14/19, 19:03 - Sara: Mama would be sad anyway :(
12/14/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But even more xd
12/14/19, 19:03 - Sara: Why you hate her
12/14/19, 19:03 - Sara: Such a bad son
12/14/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't hate her, that's why I don't want a child xd
12/14/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Come on, I'm the best son
12/14/19, 19:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are a bad daughter, you laugh at your mother for saying that I'm guapo
12/14/19, 19:04 - Sara: I should call mama Doro and talk to her
12/14/19, 19:04 - Sara: Because she lied c;
12/14/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you, your opinion on the topic is irrelevant, you're biased
12/14/19, 19:05 - Sara: Fair enough
12/14/19, 19:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: When did I tell you her name?
12/14/19, 19:05 - Sara: Secret 😈
12/14/19, 19:05 - Sara: I asked you once
12/14/19, 19:06 - Sara: Also, when you gave me the address :P
12/14/19, 19:06 - Sara: I don’t remember your father’s name :(
12/14/19, 19:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want her phone number?
12/14/19, 19:06 - Sara: Please
12/14/19, 19:06 - Sara: I’d talk with her a lot
12/14/19, 19:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: +48 609 071 421
12/14/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: She has WhatsApp as well so feel free
12/14/19, 19:07 - Sara: Thanks :P
12/14/19, 19:07 - Sara: HAHAHHAHHAHA
12/14/19, 19:07 - Sara: I’ll ask her what sex toy I can send to you
12/14/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can talk to her in English or Spanish, maybe that will motivate to study a bit xd
12/14/19, 19:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Motivate her*
12/14/19, 19:08 - Sara: Again
12/14/19, 19:08 - Sara: Xd
12/14/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why, I want her to be better and learn more, what's wrong with that
12/14/19, 19:09 - Sara: As well
12/14/19, 19:09 - Sara: But she can be better the way she is, I guess
12/14/19, 19:09 - Sara: :P
12/14/19, 19:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Knowing another language is never a bad thing so leave me and my methods alone you bad woman
12/14/19, 19:10 - Sara: Bad bitch :P
12/14/19, 19:10 - Sara: Please

12/14/19, 19:25 - Sara: True
12/14/19, 19:25 - Sara: But i understand her view
12/14/19, 19:25 - Sara: Maybe not used to skype

12/14/19, 23:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Such mafia, it is nice that your mother is including you in her dealings, showing you the ropes, so that you can later take over her criminal empire, muy bien
12/14/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm upset that you didn't wear such nice clothes when I was there 😞
12/14/19, 23:40 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/14/19, 23:40 - Sara: Noe you care about my clothes? 🌚
12/14/19, 23:41 - Sara: Or this is serious?
12/14/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, I don't concern myself too much with something so unimportant, although I have to say that I was hoping to see you in dress a little bit more 😊
12/14/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But the weather was also not very good for that
12/14/19, 23:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: #sad
12/14/19, 23:58 - Sara: I was going to say this aha
12/14/19, 23:58 - Sara: Normally i like wearing dresses
12/14/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it warmer now?
12/14/19, 23:58 - Sara: Yes but nop
12/15/19, 00:07 - Sara: Like the one from Gabriel’s photos :p
12/15/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I like seeing them ~a little bit less than naked but still~
12/15/19, 00:15 - Sara: Oh
12/15/19, 00:15 - Sara: We should see each other in summer then :p
12/15/19, 00:16 - Sara: What kind of clothes do you like on me?
12/15/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the dresses obviously, but tight jeans are also awesome, all sorts of jackets, the jeans one with nirvana on the back is great for example
12/15/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, I don't pay that much attention but I suppose I have my favorite things
12/15/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/15/19, 11:02 - Sara: Printed 💗 thanks for everything
12/15/19, 12:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, we would need some sort of occasion for that, do you have some sort of graduation ball or something of that sort?
12/15/19, 12:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Was it helpful?
12/15/19, 12:46 - Sara: I don’t need it :p
12/15/19, 12:46 - Sara: Next time (or when I’m in Poland) we can have a formal dinner :p

12/15/19, 12:50 - Sara: How are you bb?
12/15/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I woke up not a long time ago, I feel less sick, overall improving, other than that, a bit hungry xd
12/15/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y tú?
12/15/19, 12:51 - Sara: Me he levantado a las 10
12/15/19, 12:51 - Sara: Y acabé el ensayo
12/15/19, 12:52 - Sara: Y después, he estudiado un poco
12/15/19, 12:52 - Sara: My parents’ friends are at home, so I cannot do too much
12/15/19, 12:52 - Sara: I’ll wait a bit and I’ll continue doing uni stuff
12/15/19, 12:52 - Sara: Although I have done the important things already
12/15/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, productive girl ❤️❤️❤️

12/15/19, 12:55 - Sara: But I prefer doing as much as possible in the morning and then having free time
12/15/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you slept more when I was there, I should go back
12/15/19, 12:56 - Sara: And other things...
12/15/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know what you're talking about 🌝
12/15/19, 13:17 - Sara: Celibacy from now on then :p
12/15/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you already put the photo on the satisfyer?

12/15/19, 13:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/15/19, 13:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have great taste, I like it 👏
12/15/19, 13:34 - Sara: Yayy

12/15/19, 13:35 - Sara: Ugh
12/15/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, that's what I meant
12/15/19, 13:35 - Sara: :P
12/15/19, 13:36 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/15/19, 13:37 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/15/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/15/19, 13:38 - Sara: As well
12/15/19, 13:38 - Sara: We look so cute 💗
12/15/19, 13:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: We are groot ❤️
12/15/19, 13:40 - Sara: I should name the photo like that
12/15/19, 13:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely 💝
12/15/19, 13:41 - Sara: Done :)
12/15/19, 13:41 - Sara: What are you doing?
12/15/19, 13:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just finished eating, I've been watching some videos, now maybe I'll practice something
12/15/19, 13:43 - Sara: Practice what?
12/15/19, 13:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish, guitar or maybe something else, Idk yet
12/15/19, 13:44 - Sara: Cool! Go for it :P
12/15/19, 13:44 - Sara: If you want to call tonight, i’m possibly 😍
12/15/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you, love?
12/15/19, 13:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure 💋💋💋
12/15/19, 13:45 - Sara: Greaaat
12/15/19, 13:45 - Sara: Well, goood but i cannot find my drumsticks
12/15/19, 13:46 - Sara: Also I was talking with Guada and i’m a lit uneasy
12/15/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened?
12/15/19, 13:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Madrid I think you put them somewhere in the wardrobe
12/15/19, 13:46 - Sara: Nop, not those ones
12/15/19, 13:46 - Sara: My pack of drumsticks
12/15/19, 13:47 - Sara: I have like a black bag with all of them
12/15/19, 13:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/15/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess it's one thing to talk about the situation and agree on something and another to actually put it in practice
12/15/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a lot of things that seem like a logical and rational thing to do
12/15/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: But feeling are rarely rational and logical unfortunately
12/15/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree that it seems like he treats you unfairly
12/15/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I guess it might be also more difficult to accept all of this than it is for you, different people, different reactions
12/15/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are doing your best, none of this is your fault so I would ask you to not worry too much
12/15/19, 14:00 - Sara: Thanks Kamil 💕 but I don’t know what to do
12/15/19, 14:00 - Sara: I don’t know if i’m putting too much effort on someone who does not take care of me
12/15/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if there is anything more you can do
12/15/19, 14:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: You tried talking, meeting, discussing everything, at this point I guess it's up to him
12/15/19, 14:02 - Sara: True
12/15/19, 14:02 - Sara: A relationship is about treating each other in the same way?
12/15/19, 14:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Should be, for sure
12/15/19, 14:03 - Sara: That is impossible
12/15/19, 14:03 - Sara: For instance
12/15/19, 14:03 - Sara: Do ypu think I treat you the aame way you do?
12/15/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, I'll phrase it better, not in the same way because everyone shows affection or whatever else differently but the amount of effort should be similar
12/15/19, 14:04 - Sara: Agree
12/15/19, 14:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think that captures my idea better
12/15/19, 14:04 - Sara: Yep
12/15/19, 14:04 - Sara: He was like
12/15/19, 14:05 - Sara: Would you be mad if I treat you as one more friend?
12/15/19, 14:05 - Sara: And i was like... well...
12/15/19, 14:05 - Sara: Different situations
12/15/19, 14:05 - Sara: Ugh why people have people consideration
12/15/19, 14:05 - Sara: No*
12/15/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, when you meet someone with a significantly different 'sensitivity' and values it can be a bit difficult, at least at the beginning, to see the situation from their perspective
12/15/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although you knew each other for many years so that shouldn't really be a problem anymore
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: That happened with you but we are working on it
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: And that is fine
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: Because you care
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: Does he care?
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: Nop... idk what it is in his mind
12/15/19, 14:08 - Sara: Maybe the problem is mine
12/15/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's not a question you should ask me
12/15/19, 14:09 - Sara: I know
12/15/19, 14:09 - Sara: Sometimes I wonder what I’m doing wrong
12/15/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe nothing
12/15/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: With some people I guess it just won't work, no matter what
12/15/19, 14:11 - Sara: It worked
12/15/19, 14:11 - Sara: But now there are another circumstances
12/15/19, 14:11 - Sara: I should not focus on this
12/15/19, 14:12 - Sara: I don’t want to blame myself for this
12/15/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, I think you did everything you reasonably could
12/15/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did it? You said plenty of negative things about how you felt back then
12/15/19, 14:13 - Sara: I guess it wasn’t his fault
12/15/19, 14:18 - Sara: Neither mine
12/15/19, 14:18 - Sara: But my behaviour was not good for me
12/15/19, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Either way, there is no reason to dwell on this too much and look for anyones guilt. It's past and looking back in anger solves nothing so I agree
12/15/19, 14:20 - Sara: True
12/15/19, 14:20 - Sara: I want to avoid that
12/15/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cómo estás muchacha?
12/15/19, 14:24 - Sara: Eating a bit
12/15/19, 14:24 - Sara: And organising the day of tomorrow
12/15/19, 14:24 - Sara: You?
12/15/19, 14:25 - Sara: Estoy bien 💗
12/15/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was practicing the main riff from square hammer, it's fairly easy and fun to play
12/15/19, 14:28 - Sara: Videooooo 💗
12/15/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Once I get good enough, I just started today
12/15/19, 14:29 - Sara: Okay! I hope that is not an excuse :p
12/15/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Excuse for my lack of skill xd
12/15/19, 14:31 - Sara: Nooo
12/15/19, 14:31 - Sara: I didn’t mean that
12/15/19, 14:31 - Sara: But I want to see your steps 💗
12/15/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll consider but you didn't want to show me your dancing progress 😥
12/15/19, 14:33 - Sara: But it is differentt
12/15/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: How so?
12/15/19, 14:35 - Sara: I dance horrible, you know to play ^^
12/15/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Preposterous 😑😑😑
12/15/19, 14:38 - Sara: A bit
12/15/19, 14:38 - Sara: I don’t know, I like seeing how people do what they like
12/15/19, 14:38 - Sara: And support them
12/15/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Likewise
12/15/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yet you don't show yours
12/15/19, 14:38 - Sara: But I don’t want to feel ridiculous
12/15/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me neither xd
12/15/19, 14:39 - Sara: But... no :(
12/15/19, 14:39 - Sara: You are learning, and mistakes are normal
12/15/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: So are you
12/15/19, 14:40 - Sara: But...
12/15/19, 14:40 - Sara: I don’t like what I do normally
12/15/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then why do you do it?
12/15/19, 14:41 - Sara: I like what I do but not the how
12/15/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's why you practice, no?
12/15/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Same for me
12/15/19, 14:42 - Sara: But I like growing up with you
12/15/19, 14:42 - Sara: And this is an example of that
12/15/19, 14:42 - Sara: I guess, of just because I like it
12/15/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then why are you ashamed of what you are doing?
12/15/19, 14:43 - Sara: Because I can do it better
12/15/19, 14:43 - Sara: Or I feel ridiculous
12/15/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as I said, I would never consider someone practicing to get better ridiculous
12/15/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: You really should think of yourself the same way you think of me
12/15/19, 14:45 - Sara: I know
12/15/19, 14:46 - Sara: True
12/15/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/15/19, 16:57 - Sara: 💋
12/15/19, 16:57 - Sara: Espero escucharte hablar español pronto :p
12/15/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Como debería decir eso?
12/15/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí, esto es el plan
12/15/19, 16:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
12/15/19, 16:58 - Sara: Está bien, pero cuando estoy hablando con un amigo no digo “gracias” al final
12/15/19, 16:58 - Sara: Ese es el plan*

12/15/19, 17:12 - Sara: Y muy bien 👏🏽
12/15/19, 17:27 - Sara: This message was deleted
12/15/19, 17:27 - Sara: This message was deleted
12/15/19, 17:37 - Sara: I deleted the messages because I though I had a plan with Raul
12/15/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Um, I haven't read them, what messages?
12/15/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pibonazo?
12/15/19, 17:39 - Sara: I don’t have a plan, so we can call each other after dinner
12/15/19, 17:40 - Sara: Pibonazo? What do you mean? JAJAJJA
12/15/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not that Raúl?
12/15/19, 17:40 - Sara: What happened?
12/15/19, 17:40 - Sara: I’m lost xD
12/15/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing happened xd
12/15/19, 17:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was just referring to your Instagram post
12/15/19, 17:41 - Sara: Buah
12/15/19, 17:41 - Sara: No, my friend Raul
12/15/19, 17:41 - Sara: I don’t know that guy
12/15/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't get me wrong, I'm not accusing you or anything
12/15/19, 17:42 - Sara: I tried to be nice with him but he started to approach too much and bah
12/15/19, 17:42 - Sara: I don’t know hahaha
12/15/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I trust you, so no worries
12/15/19, 17:42 - Sara: Thanks
12/15/19, 17:43 - Sara: I didn’t say it with that intention
12/15/19, 17:43 - Sara: The instagram Raul has written me with other intentions other times
12/15/19, 17:43 - Sara: My friend Raul is great
12/15/19, 17:43 - Sara: Hahahhaa
12/15/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy bien 😊
12/15/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: He is Portuguese?
12/15/19, 17:44 - Sara: Yep! How do you know?
12/15/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Name kind of sounds like that
12/15/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: He lives in Spain?
12/15/19, 17:44 - Sara: Raul is not portuguese
12/15/19, 17:44 - Sara: But his surname is
12/15/19, 17:44 - Sara: Yep! But they came
12/15/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, my knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese names is limited xd
12/15/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mostly from football
12/15/19, 17:46 - Sara: I know :p
12/15/19, 17:46 - Sara: HAHAHHAHA
12/15/19, 17:46 - Sara: Etymology is not my thing
12/15/19, 17:46 - Sara: Although it is interesting
12/15/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanish and Portuguese are not that different I suppose so it's not that hard to migrate, right?
12/15/19, 17:47 - Sara: Not at all
12/15/19, 17:47 - Sara: Portuguese comes partially from Galician ^^
12/15/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I've heard that already, that's nice
12/15/19, 17:48 - Sara: Yep
12/15/19, 17:48 - Sara: I used to learn portuguese, and there were many similarities
12/15/19, 17:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: And why did you stop?
12/15/19, 17:49 - Sara: It was a uni course
12/15/19, 17:49 - Sara: But i’d like to start again
12/15/19, 17:49 - Sara: ~And Polish~
12/15/19, 17:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: When you tell someone that you know english or spanish that's just so basic and boring
12/15/19, 17:51 - Sara: Little by little
12/15/19, 17:51 - Sara: I don’t have time
12/15/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: But when you tell someone that you know polish they will respond with kurwa xd
12/15/19, 17:51 - Sara: ><
12/15/19, 17:51 - Sara: Xdddddddd
12/15/19, 17:51 - Sara: True experience?
12/15/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kurwa and pizda apparently xd
12/15/19, 17:57 - Sara: Why? Main insults right?
12/15/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pizda was from your friend Silvia xd
12/15/19, 17:57 - Sara: I’m trying to start the introduction of my bachellor project and I’m blocked xd
12/15/19, 17:57 - Sara: I know xD
12/15/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in most cases if people know some words in polish it's the insults and for some reason it is important to announce that knowledge xd
12/15/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, from experience of writing two thesis, the beginning is always the worst and after that it just happens
12/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Which was the first Spanish word you knew?
12/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Probably ❤
12/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Btw: https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/
12/15/19, 18:06 - Sara: Check where Poland is
12/15/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Um, I don't remember tbh, maybe gracias or buenos días or something like that
12/15/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Stuff heard in the movies mostly
12/15/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buah, I'm not so sure if we should be that high
12/15/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wonder how was that tested
12/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: The parameters are in the web i think
12/15/19, 18:11 - Sara: But ef is trust-worthy
12/15/19, 18:14 - Sara: Your English is really nice
12/15/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't feel like I'm very representative of my country but well...
12/15/19, 18:15 - Sara: Who is representative? XD
12/15/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, most of the people I know don't speak English very well, if at all
12/15/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hard to tell, definitely depends where you go specifically
12/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: Warsov is better in that sense
12/15/19, 18:18 - Sara: I’m checking a bit the website and you can see in ehich provinces and cities English is better
12/15/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: I suppose it is a bit difficult for me to assess the level of English in Poland because I'm not really using it here ever
12/15/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: When you visit we can check it xd
12/15/19, 18:20 - Sara: Okay
12/15/19, 18:20 - Sara: What did you think about English in Spain?
12/15/19, 18:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I only heard yours, your sister's and a little bit of your uni friends so absolutely no clue xd
12/15/19, 18:21 - Sara: Xd
12/15/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I came on my own and had to use it a bit in restaurants and other places then I would have a better picture, I guess
12/15/19, 18:23 - Sara: More accurate i’d say
12/15/19, 18:23 - Sara: Xd
12/15/19, 20:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/15/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, I've been doing some B1 level readings in spanish
12/15/19, 20:12 - Sara: Too easy?
12/15/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, they are labeled B1 but it's a bit uneven, some are easier, some are harder
12/15/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, not bad
12/15/19, 20:13 - Sara: True, it is hard to determine the level
12/15/19, 20:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lingua.com, nice website, has texts in many languages, even in polish, to my suprise
12/15/19, 20:14 - Sara: Cool! I’ll try to check
12/15/19, 20:16 - Sara: I’m probably going to an open mic tomorrow and i have selected some poems
12/15/19, 20:16 - Sara: I used to write around 2011-2013 and damn
12/15/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Will there be some recordings of it? I would love to see it
12/15/19, 20:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: A long time ago
12/15/19, 20:17 - Sara: Yes... but I liked a poem I wrote
12/15/19, 20:17 - Sara: Raul will come with me ^^
12/15/19, 20:18 - Sara: Most of them are ug
12/15/19, 20:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't say that it's bad because it's old, just stating the fact, I don't even remember what I did in 2011 xd
12/15/19, 20:18 - Sara: I know I know haha
12/15/19, 20:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/15/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It would be nice, your sister indirectly kissing me, her words, not mine xd
12/15/19, 20:26 - Sara: A three-some man? Xd
12/15/19, 20:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think she meant that if she kissed you, she would be indirectly kissing me xd
12/15/19, 20:27 - Sara: No no i know
12/15/19, 20:27 - Sara: But it is a suggestion HAHAHHAHAHA

12/15/19, 21:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I imagine he already had tickets but fortunately it was a false alarm
12/15/19, 21:39 - Sara: True
12/15/19, 21:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a bit of a shame, I would have someone to play pool with
12/15/19, 21:39 - Sara: :,(
12/15/19, 21:39 - Sara: Wait Andraz (?)
12/15/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did he also get someone pregnant?
12/15/19, 21:41 - Sara: Nop
12/15/19, 21:41 - Sara: I hope not xD

12/15/19, 21:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes but I'm not going to ask him to come with me just for that

12/16/19, 11:49 - Sara: Yay!
12/16/19, 11:49 - Sara: Did you know that Tobias has/had another band?
12/16/19, 11:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Repugnant?
12/16/19, 11:53 - Sara: Probably, but i don’t know the name
12/16/19, 11:53 - Sara: I heard something long time ago
12/16/19, 11:53 - Sara: How are you babe? 💗
12/16/19, 11:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not bad, just chilling and using my time while my brother is not here yet xd
12/16/19, 11:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y tú? Qué tal cariño?
12/16/19, 11:55 - Sara: How? 🌝
12/16/19, 11:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not like that xd
12/16/19, 11:55 - Sara: Good, a little bit uneasy all of a sudden for the internship
12/16/19, 11:55 - Sara: And I had a shower and now i’m studying
12/16/19, 11:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened?
12/16/19, 11:56 - Sara: I don’t get answers
12/16/19, 11:56 - Sara: I emailed then again
12/16/19, 11:56 - Sara: Neither from my promotor, who has to tell me that the highschools have accepted me
12/16/19, 11:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we don't know how long it takes, I suppose
12/16/19, 11:57 - Sara: Yes.. but holidays are going to come, and January i’ll be having the exams
12/16/19, 11:57 - Sara: So i want to know it asap
12/16/19, 11:57 - Sara: And in february start
12/16/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I know
12/16/19, 11:58 - Sara: So idk 😐
12/16/19, 11:58 - Sara: Now I cannot focus on my study xd
12/16/19, 11:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Should I go and pay them a visit? 🤜
12/16/19, 11:59 - Sara: Yesss
12/16/19, 11:59 - Sara: But visit me first :P
12/16/19, 11:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I'll put on some appropriate clothes and I'm on my way
12/16/19, 12:00 - Sara: Naked? Blazer?
12/16/19, 12:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 12:02 - Sara: Excellent 😈
12/16/19, 12:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~(ehhh, I didn't know that this job will be so hard, I will have to renegotiate my payment with Paco)~
12/16/19, 12:04 - Sara: Ohhhhh
12/16/19, 12:04 - Sara: Maybe I can help 🤔
12/16/19, 12:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: perhaps, now it's like a monthly subscription to hapinness but sometimes it gets much more difficult so maybe some extra money should be in order, employer intimidation is not included in the basic, monthly plan, it's part of the premium plan
12/16/19, 12:09 - Sara: Don’t get Paco angry
12/16/19, 12:09 - Sara: He is part of the mafia u know
12/16/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: yeah, and I don't work for free, I'm an expert in making complex clients happy and I should get paid accordingly
12/16/19, 12:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: conditions changed, so renegotation is required
12/16/19, 12:16 - Sara: Complex clients? HAHHAA
12/16/19, 13:22 - Sara: https://t.co/KImVoIhGs4?ssr=true
12/16/19, 13:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Off topic but yesterday I was thinking about Madrid and I realized that when walking around there I kind of missed the canals, like in Ghent
12/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: We do not have canals
12/16/19, 13:49 - Sara: But yep, I miss them too
12/16/19, 13:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I know and I was thinking that it is something that I was missing there
12/16/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I just got used to them, they are quite nice for taking a walk
12/16/19, 13:54 - Sara: Yes... and drinking
12/16/19, 13:54 - Sara: Ay ❤
12/16/19, 13:54 - Sara: How is your day going?
12/16/19, 13:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: There was something magical about sitting on the edge of the canal on a sunny day ❤️
12/16/19, 13:56 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about this exact video xd
12/16/19, 13:57 - Sara: Yay
12/16/19, 13:57 - Sara: Hahaha the first one we have i think
12/16/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been also thinking that it would probably be great to live in a city close to the sea, Idk, I just kind of like having water in or close to the city, what do you think?
12/16/19, 14:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, do you have some dream place where you would like to live?
12/16/19, 14:06 - Sara: “What do you think?” 💕
12/16/19, 14:06 - Sara: I agree, I love water so much
12/16/19, 14:07 - Sara: And I remember our experience in Oostende and ❤
12/16/19, 14:07 - Sara: Not really! Idk if living only in one place in general
12/16/19, 14:07 - Sara: What about you?
12/16/19, 14:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, at least for some time I mean, not necessarily the whole life
12/16/19, 14:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure, I've been thinking about Barcelona
12/16/19, 14:08 - Sara: I’d like to try too many places
12/16/19, 14:08 - Sara: What a surprise xd
12/16/19, 14:08 - Sara: I wouldn’t complain ^^
12/16/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's in Spain, it is close to the sea and it's beautiful, so at least at the moment it fits most of my ideas ❤️
12/16/19, 14:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which ones?
12/16/19, 14:09 - Sara: That is nice :)))
12/16/19, 14:09 - Sara: Idk for sure
12/16/19, 14:09 - Sara: But trying
12/16/19, 14:10 - Sara: I wouldn’t complain about Australia
12/16/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I heard that recently there were some political problems there
12/16/19, 14:10 - Sara: Oh really? Why?
12/16/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: And overall democracy is not doing so well there
12/16/19, 14:11 - Sara: Oh shit
12/16/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.sbs.com.au/news/the-feed/australia-s-democracy-has-been-downgraded-from-open-to-narrowed
12/16/19, 14:12 - Sara: :(
12/16/19, 14:12 - Sara: Sad
12/16/19, 14:12 - Sara: Or maybe Nordic countries
12/16/19, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't properly researched the topic yet
12/16/19, 14:12 - Sara: I fell ij love with them
12/16/19, 14:12 - Sara: Norway is amazing
12/16/19, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't know that you like cold xd
12/16/19, 14:13 - Sara: Hahahahahga i have to get used to xd
12/16/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I still prefer Barcelona, especially the idea that in the summer I could just casually go to the beach whenever I feel like and have time ❤️
12/16/19, 14:29 - Sara: I thought you hated Spain xD
12/16/19, 14:29 - Sara: I agree!
12/16/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's Catalonia, not Spain 😾
12/16/19, 14:30 - Sara: Oh true true
12/16/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's entirely possible that once I get there I would still hate it because it would be too hot xd
12/16/19, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't know, I need to try
12/16/19, 14:30 - Sara: Xddd grumpy Kamil
12/16/19, 14:31 - Sara: Since when do you want to live there?
12/16/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: For some months I've been thinking what would be the best place for me
12/16/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I still don't know but Barcelona seems nice
12/16/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also Lisbon probably
12/16/19, 14:32 - Sara: Near Madrid...
12/16/19, 14:32 - Sara: Portugal is a great country
12/16/19, 14:33 - Sara: And you go to one of the hottest place in Europe xd
12/16/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, everywhere else it's too cold for going to the beach xd
12/16/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't like France xddd
12/16/19, 14:34 - Sara: Hahahha

12/16/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's on an Erasmus website so it's probably verified
12/16/19, 14:54 - Sara: That for sure ^^

12/16/19, 23:03 - Sara: No no, do not worry
12/16/19, 23:03 - Sara: I can text you
12/16/19, 23:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, so tell me
12/16/19, 23:05 - Sara: Now I realised we came sooner as expected to the open mic :( #sad
12/16/19, 23:05 - Sara: Maybe I try on Thursday (=
12/16/19, 23:05 - Sara: (?
12/16/19, 23:05 - Sara: Sex class or try to recite poetry? 🤔
12/16/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Poetry about sex class?
12/16/19, 23:07 - Sara: Maybe I can write about it
12/16/19, 23:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, depends on how much you want to recite, you can always do it after christmas
12/16/19, 23:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you ok?
12/16/19, 23:09 - Sara: I thought about that
12/16/19, 23:09 - Sara: I feel a little bit sad for that
12/16/19, 23:09 - Sara: And also about Guada
12/16/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
12/16/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 23:11 - Sara: He started telling me that he does not want to have duties with me or with any friend
12/16/19, 23:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Duties?
12/16/19, 23:11 - Sara: (and it was like... even friends needs their care...)
12/16/19, 23:12 - Sara: And he tells me that he met a friend who haven't seen for 2 months and they spent the day together
12/16/19, 23:13 - Sara: And later he continúes saying that the treatment I want from him is like from a relationship (and I was like...because I want to be taken care and to know that a person is still intereses in meeting me...okay)
12/16/19, 23:14 - Sara: That he cannot give the friendship as Christian, Ricardo or you (and me like wtf)
12/16/19, 23:14 - Sara: He does not like to be part of a problem I have, and I answered that I want to solve this situation. If he runs away, i'm bad
12/16/19, 23:15 - Sara: Later he is like ''i don't want to hurt you, I do it when we meet...''
12/16/19, 23:16 - Sara: And wha shoked me the most was that he admits that he does not want to depende on me, because he would meet me 24/7
12/16/19, 23:16 - Sara: So I see his view indirectly
12/16/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I understand this part completely
12/16/19, 23:18 - Sara: Wait
12/16/19, 23:18 - Sara: [19:38, 12/16/2019] Guada: Quiero no depender de ti
[19:38, 12/16/2019] Guada: Eso es lo que quiero
[19:38, 12/16/2019] Guada: Porque estaría quedando 24/7 contigo
12/16/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: He cannot do that because of your history together or some other reason?
12/16/19, 23:19 - Sara: He didn't say more
12/16/19, 23:21 - Sara: So I'm confused
12/16/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I can understand that part a bit, you do have pretty close relations with friends (which is not bad if you have control over it) , depends on what he considers a relationship treatment
12/16/19, 23:21 - Sara: I don't understand
12/16/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it is still difficult to move on from the relationship for him, understandable I suppose
12/16/19, 23:22 - Sara: What about if it is me?
12/16/19, 23:22 - Sara: That I indirectly want his friendship for that?
12/16/19, 23:22 - Sara: Idk right now
12/16/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perhaps he actually wanted to try still being  friends but in the end it was to difficult, that would explain the mood change
12/16/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is complex
12/16/19, 23:23 - Sara: I don't know why i insist
12/16/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, a lot of time together, I think that's enough reason to insist
12/16/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I guess at some point you should consider if you still should, maybe you need more space and you can try again later
12/16/19, 23:25 - Sara: Is it better to keep apart?
12/16/19, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it good to stay around like that and suffer?
12/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: I guess not
12/16/19, 23:26 - Sara: But I feel guilty
12/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
12/16/19, 23:27 - Sara: Idk what conception he has about me
12/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Was anything that happened your fault?
12/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: From what I saw you made an effort to make it work
12/16/19, 23:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite admirable actually
12/16/19, 23:28 - Sara: I don't know right now
12/16/19, 23:28 - Sara: Why?
12/16/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in many cases when the relationship is over there is no interest in friendship after that, at least from what I saw so far
12/16/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you tried anyway, even when it wasn't easy
12/16/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's quite great, I told you that I admire how much you care about people
12/16/19, 23:29 - Sara: Thanks 💕
12/16/19, 23:30 - Sara: In many cases, as you have expefiences, I feel that everything is my responsibility
12/16/19, 23:30 - Sara: And well, that cannot me fulfilled if it is not solved
12/16/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: You cannot force someone to like you, I guess it can feel like that for him, that you're insisting and trying to force something
12/16/19, 23:31 - Sara: 😔
12/16/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it should be what you often told me, just let things happen
12/16/19, 23:32 - Sara: True...
12/16/19, 23:32 - Sara: But I have a sense of failure
12/16/19, 23:33 - Sara: Why people reject me so easily 😔
12/16/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't see any other way, as I said, perhaps some time apart can let both of you heal and get better
12/16/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do they?
12/16/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Situation of you and Guada is complex and involves a lot of memories and feelings, I think it is everything but easy at this point
12/16/19, 23:36 - Sara: True
12/16/19, 23:36 - Sara: I understand you
12/16/19, 23:36 - Sara: Sometimes I fee that way
12/16/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Life works that way unfortunately, most of the people don't stay in your life forever, some do and these are the ones you should cherish instead being sad about the ones that left
12/16/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Instead of
12/16/19, 23:38 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 23:39 - Sara: I agree a lot
12/16/19, 23:39 - Sara: But it hurts I guess
12/16/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, it does unfortunately
12/16/19, 23:41 - Sara: 😢
12/16/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, considering my intention of traveling and changing places I personally just accept that as something that will happen, still hurts but I don't see a way around that problem
12/16/19, 23:42 - Sara: About what exactly?
12/16/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I can have at least one person around me that stays, I'm happy
12/16/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, when you go to live in another country you inevitably leave your friends behind, it's quite difficult to maintain the friendship while being far physically
12/16/19, 23:43 - Sara: Agree
12/16/19, 23:43 - Sara: I’m afraid of being alone, of not having friends
12/16/19, 23:43 - Sara: Oh oh mental breakdown is coming xd
12/16/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have many good friends that I'm pretty sure won't leave you alone
12/16/19, 23:44 - Sara: Yes I guess
12/16/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: And if you decide to move somewhere else, I'm also sure it will be fine, in Ghent it didn't take long to find a great group of people, why should it be different somewhere else
12/16/19, 23:45 - Sara: But i don’t know if i have a group of friends, idk
12/16/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
12/16/19, 23:45 - Sara: As well, and I’m proud of that
12/16/19, 23:45 - Sara: No sense of belonging
12/16/19, 23:46 - Sara: It is fine to meet people individually, it is the best way to know the other
12/16/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I agree, in a group of people sometimes I feel a bit lost
12/16/19, 23:47 - Sara: I shouldn’t sabotage myself xd
12/16/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I should go check because I think my dog is sad now
12/16/19, 23:47 - Sara: Oh no D:
12/16/19, 23:49 - Sara: I stopped i stopped
12/16/19, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, he looks better now 😊
12/16/19, 23:50 - Sara: 💕
12/16/19, 23:50 - Sara: 😃
12/16/19, 23:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 23:51 - Sara: Sorry, i’m feeling bad about my body and taking photos for you helps
12/16/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I obviously think that you are not responsible for everything and you shouldn't feel that way but one thing that you are responsible for is my dog's well-being and you should take that seriously ☺️
12/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
12/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: 🐶💕
12/16/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'm never angry about seeing you, in person or in photos 💋💋💋
12/16/19, 23:52 - Sara: Thanks
12/16/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola tetas 😘
12/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: Xd
12/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: They say ciao
12/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: :p
12/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: Why I am that useless xd
12/16/19, 23:53 - Sara: I say to myself I should eat better and then I eat shit
12/16/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: How long did it take you to become vegan?
12/16/19, 23:54 - Sara: 2-3 years
12/16/19, 23:54 - Sara: But I sin
12/16/19, 23:54 - Sara: Sometimes
12/16/19, 23:55 - Sara: Most of them because anxiety
12/16/19, 23:55 - Sara: I should write my 2020 aims soon
12/16/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I consider this similar, better eating habits won't happen overnight
12/16/19, 23:55 - Sara: That would help me
12/16/19, 23:55 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/16/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want to eat healthier, I consider it a sort of similar transition like veganism, step by step
12/16/19, 23:56 - Sara: True
12/16/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you can set yourself some limits instead of trying to limit unhealthy stuff to zero immediately
12/16/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: And gradually lower those limits
12/16/19, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, just an idea
12/16/19, 23:58 - Sara: You are right
12/16/19, 23:58 - Sara: I hope I can change this year
12/16/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can talk about the aims later when you have time
12/16/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you want
12/16/19, 23:59 - Sara: Of course 💕
12/17/19, 00:00 - Sara: Thanks for helping me
12/17/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, always 💋
12/17/19, 00:01 - Sara: I hope not to be always like thi
12/17/19, 00:01 - Sara: This*
12/17/19, 00:07 - Sara: Idk if going to sleep
12/17/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sleep never hurts, I wish I could be there 💋
12/17/19, 00:08 - Sara: The same
12/17/19, 00:08 - Sara: 🤗
12/17/19, 00:08 - Sara: Good night then
12/17/19, 00:09 - Sara: Now i feel weird, idk why xD
12/17/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did you talk to your sister about a trip?
12/17/19, 00:09 - Sara: Forgot about it
12/17/19, 00:10 - Sara: But probably she’ll work in that week
12/17/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: No worries, sleep well, love 😘
12/17/19, 00:10 - Sara: Tomorrow I ask
12/17/19, 00:10 - Sara: Sorry!

12/17/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are at least an 8/10 ❤️❤️❤️
12/17/19, 13:31 - Sara: 👏🏽
12/17/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: As for Guada, I'm sorry for you for what happened but at the same time, as you said, now at least it's clear and you can move on
12/17/19, 13:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's something
12/17/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactly, I think your sister misunderstood me when I told her that 👀
12/17/19, 13:44 - Sara: That’s so real
12/17/19, 13:45 - Sara: I’d need support but most  the way is already done
12/17/19, 13:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whenever you need me, I'm here babe ❤️
12/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: Kamil
12/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: You are an angel
12/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: I swear it
12/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: Gracias 💕
12/17/19, 13:52 - Sara: Tú estás bien?
12/17/19, 13:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, technically Lucifer is also an angel, can I be lucifer?
12/17/19, 13:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí, bastante bien, todavía un poco enfermo, pero no muy mal
12/17/19, 13:54 - Sara: Are you going to be good?
12/17/19, 13:55 - Sara: Me alegro! Qué haces?
12/17/19, 13:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Un poco videojuegos antes mi hermano regresa xd
12/17/19, 13:57 - Sara: Un poco de videojuegos antes de que mi hermano regrese* ^^
12/17/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you still haven't watched the series so you'll never know 🤔
12/17/19, 13:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Subjunctive, right?

12/17/19, 14:43 - Sara: I think 26 januart to 2 february
12/17/19, 14:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for me it's most likely fine, I don't know if it's going to be before or after my defense, but worst case scenario, we'll just visit Lodz for a day or two
12/17/19, 14:53 - Sara: Kamil
12/17/19, 14:53 - Sara: I don’t want to be a burden :(
12/17/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not a burden, just a possible minor inconvenience
12/17/19, 14:55 - Sara: If it is not okay for you, it is fine
12/17/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unfortunately I won't know for sure the date until around 2 weeks before the defense so we'll just have to live with that
12/17/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I want to see you 💋
12/17/19, 14:56 - Sara: Okay

12/18/19, 23:27 - Sara: But obv nop xD

12/18/19, 23:28 - Sara: I searched for boobs and this gif came xd
12/18/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I follow
12/18/19, 23:29 - Sara: Kamil
12/18/19, 23:29 - Sara: Boobs
12/18/19, 23:29 - Sara: HAHAHAHA
12/18/19, 23:29 - Sara: Glad that you didn’t focused on the boobs haha
12/18/19, 23:29 - Sara: If I can help showing my boobs xD
12/18/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've seen too many of these kind of things, boobs are always a distraction from something else, like a gorilla xddd
12/18/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously like you need to ask ❤️
12/18/19, 23:30 - Sara: 🦍
12/18/19, 23:31 - Sara: Why?
12/18/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean that it's obvious and you don't need to ask me to do that
12/18/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Unexpected boobs are very nice 💋
12/18/19, 23:32 - Sara: Maybe there are days you don’t feel like
12/18/19, 23:32 - Sara: I say the same to you :P
12/18/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would need to be one foot in the grave
12/18/19, 23:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that might still not be enough xd
12/18/19, 23:33 - Sara: I like unexpected photos as well
12/18/19, 23:33 - Sara: But imagine you are with you mother HAHAHA
12/18/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: You want to see my mother's boobs? Kinky
12/18/19, 23:34 - Sara: NO
12/18/19, 23:34 - Sara: i have not said that HAHHA
12/18/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Suuuuure 😉
12/18/19, 23:35 - Sara: MILF
12/18/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't think she's interested
12/18/19, 23:35 - Sara: My fav thing in the world
12/18/19, 23:35 - Sara: Llorando :,(
12/18/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll have it in mind, these days I wasn't feeling so well and it didn't cross my mind, sorry
12/18/19, 23:40 - Sara: Oh
12/18/19, 23:40 - Sara: Why? Are you okay?
12/18/19, 23:40 - Sara: 0% indirect. Do not worry 💗
12/18/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, I mean the sickness
12/18/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm feeling better
12/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: Fair enough
12/18/19, 23:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not 100% but better
12/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: Little by little 💪
12/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
12/18/19, 23:41 - Sara: I hope my kisses help
12/18/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you were sick when I arrived in Spain, so I'm not sure, but it was worth it anyway ❤️❤️❤️
12/18/19, 23:43 - Sara: A little bit, but not as you
12/18/19, 23:43 - Sara: I though I had conjuntivitis so not bad xd
12/18/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara 'the plague' de la Torre
12/18/19, 23:44 - Sara: You are the sick one 😑
12/18/19, 23:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wasn't before I met you xd
12/18/19, 23:44 - Sara: 🥺
12/18/19, 23:45 - Sara: I couldn’t kill you
12/18/19, 23:45 - Sara: #sad
12/18/19, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need to catch some more deadly disease to spread
12/18/19, 23:46 - Sara: Sexual one maybe?
12/18/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: These are not very deadly, I think
12/18/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Somehow I expected this to be your answer xd
12/18/19, 23:50 - Sara: Why? C:
12/18/19, 23:50 - Sara: AIDS?
12/18/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: These days it can be forced into remission and people live with it for very long actually
12/18/19, 23:51 - Sara: Mmm
12/18/19, 23:51 - Sara: Sifilis?
12/18/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just a guess xd 👀
12/18/19, 23:51 - Sara: I’m always talking about that, right? Xd
12/18/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm never approaching you without a condom again
12/18/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Scratch that, I'm never approaching you within 10 meters again
12/18/19, 23:53 - Sara: C:
12/18/19, 23:53 - Sara: Haha you love me
12/18/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Additionally, it's super effective against pregnancy which is probably the worst thing that you can catch from having sex
12/18/19, 23:54 - Sara: Babies
12/18/19, 23:54 - Sara: Ugh
12/18/19, 23:54 - Sara: 👶
12/18/19, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Medium distance relationship xd
12/18/19, 23:55 - Sara: Shorter than now? XD
12/18/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, 10 meters should be enough, Spain to Poland distance is super safe but may be a bit of an overkill
12/18/19, 23:57 - Sara: Why overkill? It is better :o
12/18/19, 23:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't mind seeing you, just touching is a bit risky
12/19/19, 00:01 - Sara: Okay
12/19/19, 00:01 - Sara: Maybe with a special equipment?
12/19/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 00:04 - Sara: Pfff xd
12/19/19, 00:04 - Sara: How can you finger me? :;
12/19/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I would have gloves so quite easily, and in any hole too, without the risk of shit happening
12/19/19, 00:07 - Sara: HAHAHHA
12/19/19, 00:08 - Sara: There wasn’t xD
12/19/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you raised that concern, this solves the problem
12/19/19, 00:10 - Sara: :(
12/19/19, 00:10 - Sara: I should buy it for Poland
12/19/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you decided something about the trip?
12/19/19, 00:12 - Sara: I want to ask my parents although it is not their business
12/19/19, 00:12 - Sara: Makes me feel comfortable idk why
12/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: And if they don’t say anything wrong, i’d like to buy them
12/19/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: You like synagogues, right?
12/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: Visiting them, I guess
12/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: Religious buildings
12/19/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was actually looking at things to visit in Cracow today
12/19/19, 00:13 - Sara: Aw 💗
12/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: 7 days there might be a bit too much, tbh
12/19/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was considering maybe going further south to the mountains as well, but I would need to think about it
12/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: Okaay
12/19/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's around 2 hours by train from Cracow so not very far
12/19/19, 00:15 - Sara: Too cold there in january-february?
12/19/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure, tbh
12/19/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't thought about the details yet, it was just a brief idea
12/19/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, define too cold xdd
12/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: Less than 5 degrees xd
12/19/19, 00:16 - Sara: 👍
12/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAA
12/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't visit xd
12/19/19, 00:17 - Sara: 0?
12/19/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: In January I would expect, Idk, maybe around - 10
12/19/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hard to tell, I never checked the weather for that region
12/19/19, 00:18 - Sara: Won’t I die?
12/19/19, 00:18 - Sara: :S
12/19/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: No promises xd
12/19/19, 00:20 - Sara: :(
12/19/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your sister is coming as well, right?
12/19/19, 00:20 - Sara: Xd
12/19/19, 00:20 - Sara: Nop
12/19/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Oh, I thought you asked her and she agreed, I must've misunderstood
12/19/19, 00:21 - Sara: Completely
12/19/19, 00:21 - Sara: About everything
12/19/19, 00:22 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, it's actually warmer, on average 0 during the day and - 3 during the night
12/19/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Averages for last January
12/19/19, 00:24 - Sara: Okay
12/19/19, 00:24 - Sara: I will think about that
12/19/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, with proper winter clothes I never had any big issues
12/19/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: And we can always stop in one of the many cosy cafés and have hot chocolate 😊
12/19/19, 00:26 - Sara: 💗
12/19/19, 00:26 - Sara: I’m seriously afraid xd
12/19/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you've been in Poland in winter already, was it so bad?
12/19/19, 00:27 - Sara: In november
12/19/19, 00:27 - Sara: Well... i remember some moments.. 🥶
12/19/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need a Christmas jumper 💋
12/19/19, 00:28 - Sara: Definitely
12/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: I’m a little bit sad xS
12/19/19, 00:29 - Sara: I don’t like cooold :(
12/19/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will just carry you around in a sleeping bag like a burrito
12/19/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope it will be a bit snowy in January, the city looks completely different then and I quite like that
12/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: So beautiful 💗
12/19/19, 00:31 - Sara: Please 🥰
12/19/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some years ago nobody would even consider that it could be not snowy in January, it's kind of sad
12/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: Yes :(
12/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: Pollution c:
12/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: I think i’m going to sleep
12/19/19, 00:32 - Sara: I hope not to worry about the temperature, seriously xd

12/19/19, 00:34 - Sara: But hardly xd
12/19/19, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we can always just stay in the room for 7 days, I don't mind 💋

12/19/19, 14:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola chica, que tal? 💋
12/19/19, 14:31 - Sara: Hola 👋
12/19/19, 14:31 - Sara: Estudiando
12/19/19, 14:32 - Sara: Y duchada ✌
12/19/19, 14:32 - Sara: Tú bien? Ocupado?
12/19/19, 14:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí, un poco con tesis
12/19/19, 14:33 - Sara: Con la tesis*
12/19/19, 14:33 - Sara: Y cómo está la tesis?
12/19/19, 14:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Poco a poco
12/19/19, 14:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Aburrido, pero tengo que terminar finalmente
12/19/19, 14:34 - Sara: Te queda mucho?
12/19/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: No estoy seguro, no tan mucho
12/19/19, 14:35 - Sara: No mucho*
12/19/19, 14:36 - Sara: Eso está bien
12/19/19, 14:36 - Sara: Y has hecho algo más?
12/19/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
12/19/19, 14:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y tú?
12/19/19, 14:37 - Sara: He ido a clase, he estado con María en la cafetería, me he duchado y comido, y ahora estoy estudiando
12/19/19, 14:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy bien 😊
12/19/19, 14:40 - Sara: 🥰
12/19/19, 14:41 - Sara: Seguiré estudiando hasta las 7
12/19/19, 14:43 - Sara: Tú?
12/19/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hasta acabo la tesis
12/19/19, 14:49 - Sara: A qué te refieres? 🤔
12/19/19, 14:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: That I will continue working until I finish
12/19/19, 14:56 - Sara: ‘Mmmm
12/19/19, 14:56 - Sara: It does not sound good 🤔
12/19/19, 14:56 - Sara: But idk how to say it similarly
12/19/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant to say 'until I finish the thesis'
12/19/19, 14:58 - Sara: Oh
12/19/19, 14:58 - Sara: Hasta que acabe la tesis
12/19/19, 14:58 - Sara: But i don’t understand even the sentence in context xd
12/19/19, 14:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you said you will continue studying until 7 and asked me 'tú?' so I wanted to say that I will continue until I finish
12/19/19, 15:08 - Sara: Okk
12/19/19, 15:08 - Sara: Continuaré con la tesis hasta acabarla
12/19/19, 15:10 - Sara: I’d say it like that
12/19/19, 15:10 - Sara: You forgot the verb haha
12/19/19, 18:38 - Sara: 🤔

12/19/19, 18:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 18:58 - Sara: Definitely 💕
12/19/19, 18:58 - Sara: The feelings I had in that moment were amazing :P
12/19/19, 18:58 - Sara: How is it going, sweetheart?
12/19/19, 19:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm annoyed beyond comprehension with the thesis, but I'm making progress xd
12/19/19, 19:00 - Sara: Why?
12/19/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Promoter asked me to move some chapters around and more importantly move the pictures around so that all of them are either at the top or the bottom of the page which is very annoying to do xd
12/19/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Moving one thing moves everything else and overall it's a mess
12/19/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you?
12/19/19, 19:02 - Sara: That sucks, i know how you feel
12/19/19, 19:02 - Sara: Nice! I studied and I had extra time, so I could exercise ^^
12/19/19, 19:03 - Sara: Now i’m dressing for the sex class and then i’ll meet Ricardo
12/19/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nice, have fun
12/19/19, 19:03 - Sara: Thanks!
12/19/19, 19:04 - Sara: Vibrators yass xd
12/19/19, 19:04 - Sara: If you need something, I am here
12/19/19, 19:04 - Sara: Do not forget that 💕
12/19/19, 19:14 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a bit of a shame, because I like how you look with lipstick, but at the same time, kissing is always part of our plan xd
12/19/19, 19:28 - Sara: Rt
12/19/19, 19:29 - Sara: Well, or 1) still not painting my lips or 2) fuck everything as in Ghent xd
12/19/19, 19:29 - Sara: But i normally wear it when I know it is not going to be spoiled 🌝
12/19/19, 19:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you were laughing at me that I looked like a clown after kissing you with your red lipstick xd
12/19/19, 19:30 - Sara: Wel
12/19/19, 19:30 - Sara: Well*
12/19/19, 19:31 - Sara: I find it cute 💕
12/19/19, 19:31 - Sara: Kissing with lipstick is the same effort as traveling to Spain
12/19/19, 19:32 - Sara: Btw, do you want me to buy the tickets these days?
12/19/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not a bad idea, I guess
12/19/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking at some accommodation yesterday
12/19/19, 19:32 - Sara: Tell me :)
12/19/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: It would also be best to do that early, because it's not getting any cheaper
12/19/19, 19:33 - Sara: The accomodation or the plane?
12/19/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: But we need to make some sort of plan first, I suppose
12/19/19, 19:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Both
12/19/19, 19:33 - Sara: True
12/19/19, 19:33 - Sara: Tomorrow I see okay? ^^
12/19/19, 19:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems good
12/19/19, 20:29 - Sara: Nice ^^
12/19/19, 20:32 - Sara: I’m writing the things i want from the sex shop as a christmas lost xd
12/19/19, 20:32 - Sara: 20% discount until the end of december... and lush would be only 70 instead of 90
12/19/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, only...
12/19/19, 20:33 - Sara: Well xD
12/19/19, 20:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: That many things?
12/19/19, 20:33 - Sara: Not that much
12/19/19, 20:34 - Sara: I’m just doing time until Ricardo tell me something
12/19/19, 20:34 - Sara: I like these too:
12/19/19, 20:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tester?
12/19/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you can actually take it and...
12/19/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
12/19/19, 20:36 - Sara: I wish hahaha
12/19/19, 20:36 - Sara: Do ypu know about these?
12/19/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dissapointing
12/19/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
12/19/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I mean I suppose I get the idea xd
12/19/19, 20:37 - Sara: Later I explain it to you
12/19/19, 20:37 - Sara: But sure haha
12/19/19, 20:41 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is that?
12/19/19, 20:42 - Sara: It is like a notebook
12/19/19, 20:42 - Sara: To discover new postures I guess
12/19/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 20:45 - Sara: Wtf xddd
12/19/19, 20:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't understand why you call it conejo and not barco xd
12/19/19, 20:46 - Sara: Wtf HAHHAHA
12/19/19, 20:47 - Sara: HORRIBLE
12/19/19, 20:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😢
12/19/19, 20:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 20:52 - Sara: No lloreees
12/20/19, 00:06 - Sara: I’m at home 💕
12/20/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
12/20/19, 00:09 - Sara: Eating free donughts
12/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 00:10 - Sara: You?
12/20/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: For the last half an hour I was trying to add headers to the chapters of my thesis and I was about to break something but I finally figured out how to make them work 😡
12/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: Was it that difficult?
12/20/19, 00:11 - Sara: Oh poor baby
12/20/19, 00:12 - Sara: Now relax 💕
12/20/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Word made it tremendously difficult to make different headers on different pages
12/20/19, 00:13 - Sara: Wait
12/20/19, 00:13 - Sara: What do you mean with headers?
12/20/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Each page in word has a header and a footer, typically titles, page numbers and similar stuff goes there
12/20/19, 00:14 - Sara: Okay
12/20/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's something so simple and at the same time so frustrating to make work properly
12/20/19, 00:14 - Sara: But you made it
12/20/19, 00:14 - Sara: Right?
12/20/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, at last
12/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Congrats 💕
12/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Although it was hard, you did it
12/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Do not worry -
12/20/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if it's hard, I feel pretty stupid
12/20/19, 00:15 - Sara: Even the simplest things are the hardest
12/20/19, 00:16 - Sara: You are not stupid for that
12/20/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: That sentence makes no sense xd
12/20/19, 00:16 - Sara: Yes
12/20/19, 00:16 - Sara: Something simple can be difficult
12/20/19, 00:19 - Sara: Do you need to talk?
12/20/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok, it finally worked xd
12/20/19, 00:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Where did you get free donughts?
12/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: Sure?
12/20/19, 00:22 - Sara: I get some negative vibes
12/20/19, 00:23 - Sara: Ricardo works in the vegan donught shop and they had some they didn’t sell, so he gave me 🤗
12/20/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you also have a donught guy, like your sister xd
12/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: Yes
12/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: But hers does not give us donughts :(
12/20/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I was quite angry, but I'm fine now, no worries
12/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: Sure?
12/20/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you are better, I guess ❤️
12/20/19, 00:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, no problem
12/20/19, 00:24 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: Definitely ✌
12/20/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋💋💋
12/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: If you need to talk, tell me
12/20/19, 00:25 - Sara: And the rest? Was it nice?
12/20/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a few more things to improve but I think I more or less managed to make the most annoying changes
12/20/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall it was a frustrating day because of that but nothing serious and tomorrow I hope to make the last changes
12/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 00:26 - Sara: Nice! Good luck with it

12/21/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 01:00 - Sara: Muy bieeeen 👏🏽
12/22/19, 01:00 - Sara: Buen culo
12/22/19, 01:00 - Sara: Cara bonita
12/22/19, 01:00 - Sara: Bravo Kamil 🤗🤗🤗🤗
12/22/19, 04:16 - Sara: 💋
12/22/19, 11:58 - Sara: Btw, good morning 💗
12/22/19, 12:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola, qué tal? 💋
12/22/19, 12:28 - Sara: Estudiando 😘
12/22/19, 12:28 - Sara: Tú bien?
12/22/19, 12:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm on my way to a family dinner with the child that I unwillingly have to be a godfather for so not too happy xd
12/22/19, 12:31 - Sara: Where is the dinner? :o
12/22/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: They live in Lodz
12/22/19, 12:31 - Sara: And why are you going so soon?
12/22/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have no clue
12/22/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: My parents never bother to ask my opinion xd
12/22/19, 12:32 - Sara: You can ask
12/22/19, 12:32 - Sara: Maybe for helping
12/22/19, 12:32 - Sara: Is it for christmas?
12/22/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/22/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ask what?
12/22/19, 12:33 - Sara: Why so soon, I guess
12/22/19, 12:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: My opinion matters to them only if it's the same as theirs, at least on some topics
12/22/19, 12:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I guess I prefer to be done with this as fast as possible
12/22/19, 12:34 - Sara: As well
12/22/19, 12:34 - Sara: Because you said dinner, not lunch
12/22/19, 12:34 - Sara: Don’t you like any kind of familiar reunions?
12/22/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not at all
12/22/19, 12:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: De ningún modo
12/22/19, 12:35 - Sara: Bien bien
12/22/19, 12:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I always had a bit of an issue with the translation of meal names from polish
12/22/19, 12:36 - Sara: Well, if you don’t have people from your same age it can be weird
12/22/19, 12:36 - Sara: Oh no problem haha
12/22/19, 12:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, it is actually not unusual to have dinner like around 4 or something, before going to Ghent I typically didn't have larger meals in the evening
12/22/19, 12:37 - Sara: True, you told me that the distribution of meals are different
12/22/19, 12:37 - Sara: Kind of late lunch haha
12/22/19, 12:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Save me, pls
12/22/19, 12:39 - Sara: How?
12/22/19, 12:39 - Sara: 🚀
12/22/19, 12:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I like the way you think
12/22/19, 12:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: A nuclear strike on Lodz would definitely prevent my family dinner
12/22/19, 12:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: DO IT
12/22/19, 12:40 - Sara: Exactly what I was thinking 🤔
12/22/19, 12:40 - Sara: 💥
12/22/19, 12:40 - Sara: 💀
12/22/19, 12:40 - Sara: Well
12/22/19, 12:40 - Sara: I hope that you die with a blazer
12/22/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: In a Christmas jumper now
12/22/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Almost as good
12/22/19, 12:41 - Sara: The one you brought to Madrid?
12/22/19, 12:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí
12/22/19, 12:42 - Sara: So cute 💗
12/22/19, 12:42 - Sara: I don’t like them on me ;c
12/22/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: You prefer burritos 🌯
12/22/19, 12:43 - Sara: Yep
12/22/19, 12:43 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just read that in 2002 average temperature around Christmas in Warsaw was -15 degrees, and now there is 10 degrees there
12/22/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
12/22/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Going out?
12/22/19, 12:49 - Sara: C:
12/22/19, 12:49 - Sara: ~Thank God~
12/22/19, 12:49 - Sara: Old photo
12/22/19, 12:49 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 12:49 - Sara: Now
12/22/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️❤️
12/22/19, 12:50 - Sara: Hahaha aw
12/22/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: You have a pussy on your tetas xd
12/22/19, 12:50 - Sara: Btw
12/22/19, 12:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 12:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 12:51 - Sara: What do you think?
12/22/19, 12:51 - Sara: Wow, novel prize xd
12/22/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, in Russia or in Africa you can get killed for that, so I guess depends what kind of scale you have, I think Poland is not quite like that
12/22/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although admittedly, it's pretty shut anyway
12/22/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully the conservative party will eventually lose the elections...
12/22/19, 12:54 - Sara: How is it there?
12/22/19, 12:54 - Sara: Cross fingers
12/22/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, before the current government came to power I don't remember hearing the officials be so openly homophobic (although I might have just not heard)
12/22/19, 12:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: The dislike in general was there always probably, catholic country and what not
12/22/19, 12:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really like the churches  doctrine of loving other people ~unless they are different~
12/22/19, 12:58 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 12:58 - Sara: Well, hipocrites are everywhere
12/22/19, 12:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 13:00 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 13:00 - Sara: Accurate
12/22/19, 13:01 - Sara: Religion is a mere excuse
12/22/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Fandom is a mere excuse
12/22/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I refuse to call them Christians anymore, I will call them God fans, Jesus Fandom or something of that sort xd
12/22/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jesus groupies?
12/22/19, 13:05 - Sara: What is wrong with groupies? XD
12/22/19, 13:05 - Sara: I can call you later if I don’t go out
12/22/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing, it's just a proposed name xd
12/22/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: If I survive, sure
12/22/19, 13:06 - Sara: Maybe Father/Son/Holy Spirit fandom is more accurate
12/22/19, 13:06 - Sara: Nice ^^
12/22/19, 13:09 - Sara: I hope you have fun
12/22/19, 13:09 - Sara: 🤗
12/22/19, 13:10 - Sara: If you need something, here I am
12/22/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Three Fandoms, United in one wiki
12/22/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: So mean
12/22/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's the big plot twist of the story, that all these characters were actually a one character all the time xd
12/22/19, 13:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: For the father to be his own son, that is some tough time travel shit, I think the fandom still hasn't figured it out completely
12/22/19, 13:14 - Sara: Have fuuun 👏🏽 😃
12/22/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jodete xd
12/22/19, 13:14 - Sara: Not figured out how to lie more
12/22/19, 13:14 - Sara: Oh :(
12/22/19, 13:15 - Sara: I want you to see the bright side of life
12/22/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Either option works
12/22/19, 13:16 - Sara: I’ll have it in mind ;)
12/22/19, 14:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 14:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why would a dog open his ass?
12/22/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Am I trash?
12/22/19, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, still looking for anal tips?
12/22/19, 14:20 - Sara: 🤷🏽‍♀
12/22/19, 14:20 - Sara: Always ❤
12/22/19, 14:21 - Sara: Your gender and what that supposes? yes. You, Kamil? The most precious diamond 💕
12/22/19, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Isn't it sexist to suppose that all man are trash?
12/22/19, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Men*
12/22/19, 14:24 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/22/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Assuming something about the whole group (gender in that case)
12/22/19, 14:24 - Sara: #NotAllMen?
12/22/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mejor
12/22/19, 14:25 - Sara: No
12/22/19, 14:25 - Sara: I was joking
12/22/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wish everyone was joking when saying that
12/22/19, 14:26 - Sara: Wait
12/22/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I just don't like these generalizations, I know that you are not like that
12/22/19, 14:27 - Sara: https://www.bustle.com/articles/171595-6-reasons-not-all-men-misses-the-point-because-its-derailing-important-conversations
12/22/19, 14:27 - Sara: Read it and you’ll know the poing
12/22/19, 14:27 - Sara: Point*
12/22/19, 14:27 - Sara: Like that what?
12/22/19, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: That you don't hate or dislike anybody just for the way they were born
12/22/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Physically, I mean
12/22/19, 14:29 - Sara: Just read it
12/22/19, 14:29 - Sara: That interpretation is really basic, and lack of depth
12/22/19, 14:29 - Sara: Mine is more social
12/22/19, 14:31 - Sara: Patriarchy has determined men gender roles, which oppress women. That is trash
12/22/19, 14:32 - Sara: People who reproduce that patriarchal behaviour sucks
12/22/19, 14:32 - Sara: Gender sucks
12/22/19, 14:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always was and always will be against saying 'all' + any demographic, that includes everything and everyone, think about it whatever you want
12/22/19, 14:36 - Sara: The same
12/22/19, 14:36 - Sara: Nevermind
12/22/19, 14:36 - Sara: If you deny that male gender is oppresing, there is a problem
12/22/19, 14:37 - Sara: When we say that, it is in that way
12/22/19, 14:38 - Sara: Anyway
12/22/19, 14:39 - Sara: I can explain it it to you
12/22/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't like when people try to explain to me what And how I am, I know that quite well myself
12/22/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I don't like these jokes
12/22/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: All women are trash would a fantastic joke
12/22/19, 14:41 - Sara: Whatever
12/22/19, 14:42 - Sara: Thanks for understanding a point of view, that is nice
12/22/19, 14:42 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand that, but then saying that we're all guilty, I don't feel so good about it, if you feel like I'm doing something that opresses you than tell me
12/22/19, 14:44 - Sara: You did not understand anything
12/22/19, 14:44 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 14:45 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 14:45 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: My main issue was that joke, if it said that all women are not funny you wouldn't like it either
12/22/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: We've already had a conversation about jokes
12/22/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I made errors in that and I recognize it
12/22/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I'm sorry for that
12/22/19, 14:46 - Sara: “All women are trash” would be misogynyst
12/22/19, 14:47 - Sara: Women are whores, housewifes... and that “jokes” are real
12/22/19, 14:47 - Sara: Why do you say this?
12/22/19, 14:47 - Sara: No relation with the topic
12/22/19, 14:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: In sense that I made some senseless jokes that I didn't think through and I intend to not repeat those mistakes
12/22/19, 14:49 - Sara: This is like saying that maths are only about + and -
12/22/19, 14:50 - Sara: I know, but the topic is not related
12/22/19, 15:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I asked if I'm trash and you said that from gender perspective yes, is that fair?
12/22/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe I am trash, but not because I'm a man
12/22/19, 15:03 - Sara: What is being a man?
12/22/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know and I don't care
12/22/19, 15:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am Kamil
12/22/19, 15:03 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 15:03 - Sara: Damn, such interest
12/22/19, 15:04 - Sara: I’m not going to explain anything if you are not interested
12/22/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I meant that I act how I want and I'm at least trying to not make a gender define me
12/22/19, 15:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I see you as a person, not as a woman
12/22/19, 15:05 - Sara: Kamil, everybody is defined by gender stereotypes somehow
12/22/19, 15:05 - Sara: Unfortunately
12/22/19, 15:05 - Sara: I know
12/22/19, 15:05 - Sara: But I cannot deny that I’m killed, raped and discriminated because I’m a woman
12/22/19, 15:06 - Sara: And socially speaking, a shite man is superior
12/22/19, 15:06 - Sara: White*
12/22/19, 15:06 - Sara: Denying the social construction makes society worse
12/22/19, 15:07 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 15:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not denying it but I'm trying at least to not have it in my life and treat people as people, not as men and women
12/22/19, 15:08 - Sara: What is normal
12/22/19, 15:08 - Sara: But admit that you have a gender
12/22/19, 15:08 - Sara: And me another one
12/22/19, 15:08 - Sara: And we have been brought up differently for that
12/22/19, 15:08 - Sara: That you are not discriminated, I am
12/22/19, 15:09 - Sara: I’m not saying that you personally are discriminating
12/22/19, 15:10 - Sara: But society has established certain ideas about men and women
12/22/19, 15:11 - Sara: You cannot deny that women’s treatment is the same that men’s
12/22/19, 15:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes but I'm not taking responsibility for something I'm not guilty of, in the same way as for example I don't blame all Germans for the war or whatever
12/22/19, 15:11 - Sara: Is not
12/22/19, 15:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I change what I can, so my own behavior
12/22/19, 15:11 - Sara: Take responsability for what?
12/22/19, 15:11 - Sara: Yes, what it should be done
12/22/19, 15:12 - Sara: But admitting that men are discriminatory in other ways is not bad
12/22/19, 15:12 - Sara: Idk, it is also acknowledging the advantages of being a man in this society
12/22/19, 15:12 - Sara: And a metr shitty joke is not the same as a gender violence case c:
12/22/19, 15:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Saying something general is against my religion, I am only capable of making such claims about specific people
12/22/19, 15:14 - Sara: Kamil
12/22/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I fully admit that they exist and there is plenty of them
12/22/19, 15:14 - Sara: Are you seriously denying sexism?
12/22/19, 15:14 - Sara: Plenty: majority
12/22/19, 15:14 - Sara: What a coincidence!
12/22/19, 15:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Majority is not all
12/22/19, 15:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: That was pretty much my only point
12/22/19, 15:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everything else I agree
12/22/19, 15:15 - Sara: Majority has killed,happed, abused millions of women for their gender
12/22/19, 15:15 - Sara: Majority means that there is a sexist education
12/22/19, 15:15 - Sara: I cannot believe this xd
12/22/19, 15:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think there is a significant misunderstanding here
12/22/19, 15:16 - Sara: What
12/22/19, 15:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: You always knew that I didn't like to say 'all' about anything
12/22/19, 15:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that denying that there is a problem?
12/22/19, 15:17 - Sara: For me, yes
12/22/19, 15:18 - Sara: A whole socio-politic system
12/22/19, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a fundamental problem and I agree with that
12/22/19, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't want to deny that there are good people
12/22/19, 15:18 - Sara: I don’t deny that neither
12/22/19, 15:18 - Sara: But it is a social problem
12/22/19, 15:18 - Sara: SOCIAL
12/22/19, 15:18 - Sara: And gender is SOCIAL
12/22/19, 15:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar example as before, but I've heard a very general sentence that polish are anti Semitic, there are people like that, yes, but there are many that are not
12/22/19, 15:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: If we say that polish hate jews, than people will just assume that we all are
12/22/19, 15:21 - Sara: But that is not an opprresion
12/22/19, 15:21 - Sara: Being polish I mean
12/22/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you think, but having a common opinion of being drunk and stealing shit is not helpful
12/22/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or an opinion of being homophobic and close minded
12/22/19, 15:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Behind the enlightened west
12/22/19, 15:22 - Sara: Not understanding
12/22/19, 15:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jews were opressed , for sure
12/22/19, 15:24 - Sara: Yes
12/22/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So claims of anti semithism are similar to claims of misogyny for me
12/22/19, 15:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it fine to say all people polish are anti Semitic?
12/22/19, 15:25 - Sara: No Polish, but the oppresing group againts Jewish
12/22/19, 15:25 - Sara: That is not a well-known topic for me, so hard to use as an example
12/22/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, your topic is not so well known for me, I guess
12/22/19, 15:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's hard to deny that this is not so different
12/22/19, 15:26 - Sara: An oppresion, yes. Maybe the other one is more religious
12/22/19, 15:26 - Sara: At any moment you asked for info
12/22/19, 15:26 - Sara: Only attacking
12/22/19, 15:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It felt like you were saying: I like you, but you're still a man
12/22/19, 15:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that's not how I want to be seen
12/22/19, 15:28 - Sara: Really? Xd
12/22/19, 15:28 - Sara: No, I guess. But if you have, for instance, sexist behaviour I’d worry
12/22/19, 15:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do I?
12/22/19, 15:29 - Sara: Well, Idk if you are denying feminism
12/22/19, 15:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't want myself to be judged through that kind of lens, in no way am I denying that there is a problem
12/22/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I told you that in my opinion all women should me feminist
12/22/19, 15:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Otherwise, they just submit to the injustice being done to them
12/22/19, 15:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Judge me for what I do, not for how I look, that's pretty much all
12/22/19, 15:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk if wanting that is denying your cause
12/22/19, 15:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm doing my best to look beyond your gender but from your comments I don't know if you're making the same effort and that worries me
12/22/19, 16:01 - Sara: For instance, If you make catcalling or you call women whores, obviously you will be told
12/22/19, 16:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously, but I don't
12/22/19, 16:02 - Sara: The opposite. Normally, people who suffer from at least one oppresion tend to be more sympathetic with others. But of course, there are exceptions
12/22/19, 16:02 - Sara: Maybe you can commit other kind of actions, so I can say a comment racist.
12/22/19, 16:02 - Sara: Of course
12/22/19, 16:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: By submit, I meant accept that it happens and don't do anything
12/22/19, 16:03 - Sara: I want you to have a more broad perspective, i guess.
12/22/19, 16:03 - Sara: Yeah, that is horrible
12/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: Which is my perspective according to you?
12/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: #Feminazi xD
12/22/19, 16:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't like that term
12/22/19, 16:04 - Sara: Me neither
12/22/19, 16:05 - Sara: But I thought you thought something similar about me
12/22/19, 16:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if you look at just my actions, or if you give any importance to things I didn't choose
12/22/19, 16:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you didn't, now I'm not so sure
12/22/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope so, at least
12/22/19, 16:08 - Sara: Can I explain myself?
12/22/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course
12/22/19, 16:08 - Sara: Or already have a predetermined conception now about me?
12/22/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have that for anyone, I'm always willing to change my view, provided arguments that convince me
12/22/19, 16:14 - Sara: Haven’t provided any convincing argument?
12/22/19, 16:16 - Sara: Of course I just see how you act
12/22/19, 16:17 - Sara: But some behaviours are not individual
12/22/19, 16:17 - Sara: Is it a coincidence that many women feel horrible with their bodies, me included?
12/22/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I made my point, I never said anything about denying feminism and sexism, but it seems like because I'm white and male I am the devil or something
12/22/19, 16:17 - Sara: No?
12/22/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I do my best to convince you otherwise
12/22/19, 16:18 - Sara: Not the point of the conversation now
12/22/19, 16:18 - Sara: Just asked you if it is a coincidence
12/22/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already told you that I didn't deny any of these problems
12/22/19, 16:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you seem to see it in anything I say
12/22/19, 16:18 - Sara: For instance?
12/22/19, 16:19 - Sara: I have never pointed anything wrong at you
12/22/19, 16:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: You made very broad points
12/22/19, 16:19 - Sara: Which ones
12/22/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Saying just male gender, men or things like that sounds pretty general to me and sadly, I'm not sure if you include me in that, maybe you expect me to eventually dissapoint you, act like my gender apparently should
12/22/19, 16:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't like being seen as a part of group that I don't even feel much attachment to
12/22/19, 16:24 - Sara: Why?
12/22/19, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I see myself as an individual and that's it
12/22/19, 16:24 - Sara: Nie rozumiem
12/22/19, 16:24 - Sara: Me expecting you disappointing me?
12/22/19, 16:25 - Sara: You don’t see my point :(
12/22/19, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it's a language issue or something but some things sounded a bit like accusations and I don't know how to see that
12/22/19, 16:25 - Sara: Well
12/22/19, 16:25 - Sara: Not at all
12/22/19, 16:26 - Sara: When
12/22/19, 16:28 - Sara: I just wanted to explain de division between the person/gender
12/22/19, 16:28 - Sara: I wasn’t insulting you
12/22/19, 16:28 - Sara: But if you don’t undendestand, we can stop talking about this
12/22/19, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I understand, I hope at least, but in any case, putting me in a group based on gender, so it's the only thing that connects us does insult me, tbh
12/22/19, 16:30 - Sara: Wait
12/22/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because by that logic I'm in the same group as, Idk, Hitler or something
12/22/19, 16:30 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
12/22/19, 16:30 - Sara: Have you heard the chilean song about rape?
12/22/19, 16:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop
12/22/19, 16:30 - Sara: Why you say that, it is senseless
12/22/19, 16:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, only because of that Hitler comparison
12/22/19, 16:31 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSHUS2lehOY
12/22/19, 16:31 - Sara: I don't understand
12/22/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, comparison to Hitler is typically not a very good argument, but I guess you get the point
12/22/19, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit extreme example, but still
12/22/19, 16:32 - Sara: Not get the point
12/22/19, 16:33 - Sara: When you watch the video tell me
12/22/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how does that apply to me? Nothing new, I know about the issues they are singing about and I never denied them, like you seemed to imply before
12/22/19, 16:37 - Sara: Some men where saying: “but not all men are rapist”
12/22/19, 16:37 - Sara: the message is clear
12/22/19, 16:38 - Sara: The rapist is the whole system that allows that
12/22/19, 16:38 - Sara: So kind of similar
12/22/19, 16:38 - Sara: But maybe the men who felt “attacked” are really rapists
12/22/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: What I meant was that when you just say men, you include guys who actually do all this shit but also me and I don't want to equalized with them like that, I don't deserve it, me and others who think similarly
12/22/19, 16:40 - Sara: Kamil, I know
12/22/19, 16:40 - Sara: I’m aware
12/22/19, 16:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing connects me to the people like, Idk, Donald Trump, besides the fact that we're both men
12/22/19, 16:41 - Sara: Just gender
12/22/19, 16:41 - Sara: https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/11/30-examples-of-male-privilege/
12/22/19, 16:41 - Sara: And when you are men you have privileges
12/22/19, 16:42 - Sara: And most of men use in their benefit those privileges
12/22/19, 16:42 - Sara: Glad that you are aware
12/22/19, 16:42 - Sara: It is essential as sale for men a feminst awareness
12/22/19, 16:43 - Sara: I’m just discussing why #notallmen is rather an excuse to ignore these social privilege
12/22/19, 16:43 - Sara: But you, Kamil, are not doing anything
12/22/19, 16:44 - Sara: (I hope)
12/22/19, 16:44 - Sara: Because I can even have sexist behaviour
12/22/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I've never seen it in social media in that context, for me it's more about not being seen as a part of something I am not
12/22/19, 16:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me and others
12/22/19, 16:45 - Sara: What are you not?
12/22/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: A rapist, a sexist, a misogynyst, pick what you like
12/22/19, 16:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I think I have the right to dislike such jokes
12/22/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because for me, they are degrading
12/22/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I cannot listen to the audio now
12/22/19, 16:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm still at the dinner
12/22/19, 16:47 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 16:47 - Sara: Listen it whenever you want
12/22/19, 16:48 - Sara: Sorry, have fun
12/22/19, 16:48 - Sara: Shouldn’t use your phone
12/22/19, 16:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: No problem, I'm bored to death here
12/22/19, 16:48 - Sara: I’m not helping
12/22/19, 16:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's an important conversation
12/22/19, 16:50 - Sara: Is it?
12/22/19, 16:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess, or maybe it's useless, because nothing new was revealed, at least from my point of view, I guess
12/22/19, 16:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not sure yet
12/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 16:51 - Sara: Really your conception has not changed?
12/22/19, 16:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not particularly
12/22/19, 16:52 - Sara: 😑
12/22/19, 16:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Conception about you I mean
12/22/19, 16:53 - Sara: Oh, okay
12/22/19, 16:53 - Sara: Well, thanks
12/22/19, 16:53 - Sara: I was a bit worried I guess
12/22/19, 16:55 - Sara: I just want people around me being aware of this situation
12/22/19, 16:56 - Sara: I didn’t mean to be mean
12/22/19, 16:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't say all men are trash and it's all good
12/22/19, 16:56 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 16:56 - Sara: But okay
12/22/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know but there is a difference between saying 'don't discriminate' and saying 'you are all trash'
12/22/19, 16:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I understand the point, I did before as well
12/22/19, 16:58 - Sara: So what is the problem if I’m not refering to specifically you?
12/22/19, 16:58 - Sara: But i’m talking about shitty gender oppresion
12/22/19, 16:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: As was said here, if you phrase it correctly I understand that it's not about me, that argument is fine
12/22/19, 17:00 - Sara: Last sentence
12/22/19, 17:00 - Sara: Should I explicitly say it is not abput youv
12/22/19, 17:00 - Sara: ?
12/22/19, 17:00 - Sara: If ypu know that you are not discriminating or doing something bad
12/22/19, 17:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just saying all men are trash implies that to me that I'm included, even if it's a shitty joke, maybe that's how I understand english
12/22/19, 17:01 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it specifically says 'all' men
12/22/19, 17:01 - Sara: Read this one
12/22/19, 17:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Examples here don't say all
12/22/19, 17:03 - Sara: And it is about this
12/22/19, 17:03 - Sara: All women cannot suffer for “some men”
12/22/19, 17:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I get that point, I really do, I never said otherwise , but try to understand that this puts me on the same level as the truly shitty people, these 'some' men
12/22/19, 17:04 - Sara: But they are the vast majority
12/22/19, 17:05 - Sara: You are not like that, i know xD
12/22/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: So say 'most man are shit' instead of all?
12/22/19, 17:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Men*
12/22/19, 17:06 - Sara: But it is a matter of gender
12/22/19, 17:06 - Sara: And the people who are not like that have been deconstructed or taught
12/22/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how do you know that?
12/22/19, 17:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: How can you say that for everyone?
12/22/19, 17:07 - Sara: Society is sexist, racist
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: Everybody lives in this society
12/22/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you assume some knowledge about everyone
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: No
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: I have studied this xd
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: And sexism is born socially
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: We are though from second 1
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: Discrimination is social
12/22/19, 17:08 - Sara: Not individual
12/22/19, 17:09 - Sara: Whites hate black
12/22/19, 17:09 - Sara: Men hate women
12/22/19, 17:09 - Sara: Heterosexual hate homosexual
12/22/19, 17:09 - Sara: This is bombarded everywhere
12/22/19, 17:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I am all about individuality, and if there is a single person I haven't met and seen for myself, I won't dare say all
12/22/19, 17:09 - Sara: I have 90 pages with this and ages behind my back
12/22/19, 17:10 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/22/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I feel like if I say anything in general, about any group of people and I haven't seen all of these people, I will be degrading the individuals who are different, who don't follow the mindset of the majority
12/22/19, 17:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Statistics do not account for anomalies, but they are important for me
12/22/19, 17:11 - Sara: Not all nazis are bad xd
12/22/19, 17:12 - Sara: .
12/22/19, 17:12 - Sara: Statistics and coincidences...
12/22/19, 17:12 - Sara: Check numbers and percentages
12/22/19, 17:12 - Sara: If +90% of women have been sexually harassed is because of something
12/22/19, 17:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have you noticed that I never said anything about the majority? I know what is the view of the majority. But I refuse to forget about people who do not share the view of the majority
12/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: Do you want a medal for doing what it should be done?
12/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: I mean..
12/22/19, 17:14 - Sara: What is the difference between “most of” and “all” in this sense?
12/22/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least it acknowledges that there are some good people
12/22/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully there will be more
12/22/19, 17:15 - Sara: We know that there are
12/22/19, 17:15 - Sara: Again
12/22/19, 17:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, please, made of gold and with diamonds
12/22/19, 17:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: So proud of not being shit
12/22/19, 17:16 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 17:16 - Sara: People should not be shitty
12/22/19, 17:16 - Sara: That is not the normal thing
12/22/19, 17:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: WHERE IS MY MEDAL?
12/22/19, 17:17 - Sara: Please
12/22/19, 17:17 - Sara: XD
12/22/19, 17:17 - Sara: MANY men are like that
12/22/19, 17:17 - Sara: So many
12/22/19, 17:17 - Sara: Many many
12/22/19, 17:18 - Sara: Idk if you are joking
12/22/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, but I actually want a medal 🏅
12/22/19, 17:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: They look nice
12/22/19, 17:19 - Sara: Xd
12/22/19, 17:19 - Sara: Please
12/22/19, 17:20 - Sara: But idk, i’m afraid people not understanding me
12/22/19, 17:20 - Sara: Or discriminating me
12/22/19, 17:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: The same, you said a few times that I deny how is the majority even though I haven't done that at all
12/22/19, 17:22 - Sara: Wow
12/22/19, 17:22 - Sara: Being a woman has the same disavantages than that
12/22/19, 17:22 - Sara: Seriously?
12/22/19, 17:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: What?
12/22/19, 17:23 - Sara: Ah okay
12/22/19, 17:23 - Sara: Well, but it is not the same
12/22/19, 17:23 - Sara: The same
12/22/19, 17:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that all this time I was talking about minorities but you pointed a view of the majority a few times, which I am well aware of
12/22/19, 17:25 - Sara: A minoritary group is not the same as majority in terms of numbers
12/22/19, 17:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: And? Not my point at all
12/22/19, 17:28 - Sara: And what do you mean?
12/22/19, 17:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Saying all implies to me that there is no minority
12/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: No, i'm not refering to that
12/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: but to minority groups
12/22/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never said anything about the views of the majority which I know that are crap
12/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: like social talking
12/22/19, 17:29 - Sara: Yes, and?
12/22/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from your answers I understood that you thought I was trying to say that most of the men are not crap
12/22/19, 17:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which I did not, at any moment
12/22/19, 17:30 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 17:31 - Sara: okay okay
12/22/19, 17:32 - Sara: But the Not All Men annoys me
12/22/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm starting to think that at least partially it's also a problem with gramatical understanding of English for me, it's rather subtle
12/22/19, 17:32 - Sara: Because that denies the sexis system
12/22/19, 17:43 - Sara: I don’t want any problem
12/22/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me neither
12/22/19, 17:43 - Sara: :(
12/22/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: I’m goof
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: Good*
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: But i still thinking about what we have talked
12/22/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: Doing exercise
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: You?
12/22/19, 18:13 - Sara: Xddd
12/22/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully soon we will leave the dinner 😬
12/22/19, 18:14 - Sara: -stays 3 more hours-
12/22/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think we had significantly different context on the topic and there were misunderstandings, but overall I don't think there was any new information about me or you
12/22/19, 18:16 - Sara: Probably
12/22/19, 18:17 - Sara: Maybe I thought you had my perspective
12/22/19, 18:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't, we are different in many ways and we can probably learn more about each other and understand each other better, but I don't assume that we are already there, it will take time
12/22/19, 18:22 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/22/19, 18:22 - Sara: Why can I not learn from you now?
12/22/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can, of course
12/22/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I meant that we don't know that much about each other now
12/22/19, 18:23 - Sara: ~Googleing tests~
12/22/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that can be improved
12/22/19, 18:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think that this kind of deeper understanding can be found in tests
12/22/19, 18:24 - Sara: I know
12/22/19, 18:24 - Sara: And how?
12/22/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Discussions, arguments, overall, it will probably happen naturally over time
12/22/19, 18:25 - Sara: True
12/22/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: When some more divisive topic comes up, I guess
12/22/19, 18:25 - Sara: As well
12/22/19, 18:25 - Sara: Sorry
12/22/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why sorry?
12/22/19, 18:26 - Sara: In case it was uncomfortable
12/22/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, easy topics don't teach us anything
12/22/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I don't have any problem
12/22/19, 18:28 - Sara: Sure
12/22/19, 18:28 - Sara: But I don’t want misunderstandings between us
12/22/19, 18:28 - Sara: I don’t want to have a fake vision of you, and vice versa
12/22/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that's why we talk, I suppose
12/22/19, 18:29 - Sara: True
12/22/19, 18:29 - Sara: But anyway :s
12/22/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I expect that misunderstandings and arguments will happen and that's fine, nothing unusual
12/22/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's probably more worrying if there are no arguments because that could mean that someone may be hiding some negative feelings
12/22/19, 18:40 - Sara: True
12/22/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: And that is never healthy
12/22/19, 18:41 - Sara: But i’m afraid misunderstandings can separate
12/22/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is a possibility, but I suppose being with someone is always a bit of a risk
12/22/19, 18:41 - Sara: Well, true
12/22/19, 18:42 - Sara: And knowing that person more is better
12/22/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/22/19, 18:42 - Sara: Fair enough
12/22/19, 18:42 - Sara: But sorry anyway

12/22/19, 18:52 - Sara: I have always been like that

12/22/19, 23:18 - Sara: He is communist, right?
12/22/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, there is plenty of time before a possible meeting, I suppose
12/22/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something like that, I think
12/22/19, 23:19 - Sara: True. I wish I could study more politics and history. I really like it.
12/22/19, 23:19 - Sara: I could learn a lot from him, i’m sure ^^

12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Nop
12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Jajaha
12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Watching videos
12/23/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean in general, not right now
12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Oh, yes
12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Stretching before and after exercising
12/23/19, 00:10 - Sara: Male squirt? :o
12/23/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you can actually stretch while watching videos, I do that sometimes
12/23/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Qué?
12/23/19, 00:11 - Sara: How do you stretch?
12/23/19, 00:11 - Sara: I have just heard about that
12/23/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, while watching, nothing too complex, just try to grab my toes or something, I suppose you get the idea
12/23/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what is it supposed to be?
12/23/19, 00:13 - Sara: Like being sit in the bed?
12/23/19, 00:13 - Sara: Idk, i want to google
12/23/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: For example, yes
12/23/19, 00:13 - Sara: Can be nice
12/23/19, 00:13 - Sara: Now i’m in my chair
12/23/19, 00:14 - Sara: But i could try
12/23/19, 00:14 - Sara: Are you doing it now?
12/23/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: A bit, yes
12/23/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's useful to prevent injuries from running
12/23/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And any other activity I suppose
12/23/19, 00:15 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 00:15 - Sara: I want elasticity as well
12/23/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, it is quite nice 🌚
12/23/19, 00:17 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 00:17 - Sara: 🥔

12/23/19, 00:22 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXNbYdpvMuA&list=WL&index=1
12/23/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sara's anal adventures continue xd
12/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: 😂
12/23/19, 00:25 - Sara: So cool 😎
12/23/19, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're not a potato, you're an *ass* paragus
12/23/19, 00:27 - Sara: One of the best vegeanals
12/23/19, 00:27 - Sara: XD
12/23/19, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Have you tried?
12/23/19, 00:28 - Sara: An esparagus in my ass?
12/23/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was thinking about the other end but sure, why not
12/23/19, 00:29 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIOkz0QsH0&list=FLQ9Kf60j-czqrS94pYtsOzg&index=60&t=0s C´mon. Learn spanish xd
12/23/19, 00:29 - Sara: whut
12/23/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: The other end is mouth but if you prefer it in your ass, that's fine, no judging xd
12/23/19, 00:30 - Sara: hahaha
12/23/19, 00:31 - Sara: Well, I though it was obvious I like asparagus
12/23/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is this?
12/23/19, 00:32 - Sara: An interview I made
12/23/19, 00:32 - Sara: I participated in a short film :P
12/23/19, 00:32 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbj_8CKxBC8&list=FLQ9Kf60j-czqrS94pYtsOzg&index=12&t=0s
12/23/19, 00:43 - Sara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy8u2MbjQjw
12/23/19, 00:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: 'How did this happen, we're smarter than this' xd
12/23/19, 00:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obi wan is a gift
12/23/19, 00:46 - Sara: Absolutely
12/23/19, 00:46 - Sara: Kamil, can you help me to define myself? Xd
12/23/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: How can I help?
12/23/19, 00:46 - Sara: I’m writing a list of things that interest me
12/23/19, 00:47 - Sara: In that sense, I can develop myself in those aspects
12/23/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: A good idea 💋
12/23/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But how can I help?
12/23/19, 00:47 - Sara: Also it is a good way of seeing if ypu know me :B
12/23/19, 00:48 - Sara: Telling me things you had seen i’m interested in
12/23/19, 00:50 - Sara: I have written many things
12/23/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: -Music (specifically drums but maybe also something else like bass maybe)
-Sex (sexual education, all sorts of aspects of it I suppose, too many to list everything )
-Activism (feminist, vegan, LGBT)
-history (so far of Spain, but maybe something more as well)
-Politics (at least the main theories, always nice to know more)
-languages
-travel (I hope to cultivate this interest together)
12/23/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll keep thinking
12/23/19, 00:52 - Sara: 💕
12/23/19, 00:52 - Sara: Those are the one I wrote
12/23/19, 00:52 - Sara: Of course we can travel together 😘😘
12/23/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: -sports as well, I suppose, you just need to pick something that you really enjoy
-dancing
-singing
12/23/19, 00:53 - Sara: Sex, music, feminism, poetry, lgbt, languages, sports, veganism, history, politics, philosophy, literature, friends, travel
12/23/19, 00:53 - Sara: 🤗
12/23/19, 00:53 - Sara: You are really accurate 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
12/23/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ahhhh, I somehow missed poetry, silly me
12/23/19, 00:55 - Sara: Hahahaha
12/23/19, 00:55 - Sara: Anyway it is great
12/23/19, 00:55 - Sara: I’m still like 🥰
12/23/19, 00:55 - Sara: Can I try?
12/23/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure 😊
12/23/19, 00:56 - Sara: Okay
12/23/19, 00:56 - Sara: Engineering (robotics), informatics, language, history, travelling, exercising
12/23/19, 00:57 - Sara: Languages*
12/23/19, 00:57 - Sara: I’m sure there are more things xD
12/23/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, sports, more accurately running, but pretty much any activity, music, or more specifically guitar, I guess
12/23/19, 00:59 - Sara: Oh shit, the guitar
12/23/19, 00:59 - Sara: Rt
12/23/19, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would need to think, it's easier for me to say what interests you xd
12/23/19, 01:00 - Sara: Why?
12/23/19, 01:00 - Sara: I mean
12/23/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't thought about it that much, I have a few that I'm focused on developing so I haven't thought about the rest
12/23/19, 01:00 - Sara: Fair enough
12/23/19, 01:01 - Sara: But i think that is more about what you like
12/23/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: So main at the moment would be guitar, running, languages and programming
12/23/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Traveling to certain degree too, although I can't do it as much as I would like to
12/23/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yeah, surely there are more, I just think it's better to focus on a limited number of things
12/23/19, 01:02 - Sara: I’m a prototype xd
12/23/19, 01:02 - Sara: Yes, i agree
12/23/19, 01:02 - Sara: But we are more than what we do I guess
12/23/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Many things add up to make up who we are
12/23/19, 01:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it is an important part, for sure
12/23/19, 01:04 - Sara: Nie rozumiem
12/23/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Things we do, our interests but also for example our environment
12/23/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: People around us have a big influence on who we are
12/23/19, 01:05 - Sara: Oh
12/23/19, 01:05 - Sara: Of course
12/23/19, 01:05 - Sara: What people do you have around? How are they influencing you?
12/23/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know how strongly influenced I am, first thing is probably family, but I'm not like them, maybe they influence in a sense that I want to have a different life then them
12/23/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm the older brother so I'm not feeling particularly influenced by my sibling, although there is some influence in the other direction, it seems
12/23/19, 01:07 - Sara: You told me so
12/23/19, 01:07 - Sara: ^^
12/23/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I pick my friends so they are already sort of similar, at least in some ways
12/23/19, 01:08 - Sara: Do we?
12/23/19, 01:08 - Sara: Most of the people in my life cane suddenly xd
12/23/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: The ones I wasn't compatible with didn't stay in my life for long
12/23/19, 01:09 - Sara: True, ~forcedly gone?~
12/23/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nope
12/23/19, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Simply, nobody was willing to adapt to the other, I'm not really that interested in changing myself for someone unless the change appears as an improvement to me
12/23/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean in this case people with different interests, different goals, etc.
12/23/19, 01:11 - Sara: I agree
12/23/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, when I went to Uni and some people I knew did not and kind of started families and what not, our contact didn't survive, for example
12/23/19, 01:12 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 01:12 - Sara: People take different paths
12/23/19, 01:12 - Sara: That is really painful for me, but it is natural
12/23/19, 01:14 - Sara: I think family kind of established my most essential features
12/23/19, 01:14 - Sara: Like idk, manners I think
12/23/19, 01:14 - Sara: And then it was my sister, experiences I had with people that are gone and my actual friends and couple
12/23/19, 01:15 - Sara: And social media changed my perception a lot
12/23/19, 01:16 - Sara: I don’t know to what extend i’m more responsible of my own change that others
12/23/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Your sister seems to have influenced you a lot
12/23/19, 01:17 - Sara: You think?
12/23/19, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have to say that I'm a bit curious who would you be if you were born in a different place, if it would be a fundamentally same person or not really, same for myself, I think about it sometimes
12/23/19, 01:19 - Sara: We have been brought up at the same time
12/23/19, 01:19 - Sara: I’m happy that we have influenced each other
12/23/19, 01:19 - Sara: Idk, she gave me the ecologist perpective
12/23/19, 01:20 - Sara: And she saw me being vegetarian  and feminist and so is she
12/23/19, 01:20 - Sara: Could be nice
12/23/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Imagine Sara speaking perfect polish xd
12/23/19, 01:23 - Sara: If I were polish, do you think we would have got the opportunity to meet?
12/23/19, 01:23 - Sara: For a first sight, we are so different xd
12/23/19, 01:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue, the fact that we met was a rather lucky coincidence, I was quite close to not going on Erasmus at all because of some paperwork issues
12/23/19, 01:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: And also that you, let's say, became available at the right moment
12/23/19, 01:25 - Sara: True
12/23/19, 01:25 - Sara: Thank god I gave the first step
12/23/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: God had nothing to do with it 💋
12/23/19, 01:27 - Sara: You were on the spot 😎
12/23/19, 01:28 - Sara: February Sara didn’t expected this
12/23/19, 01:28 - Sara: But December Sara is happy 💕
12/23/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Neither did February Kamil
12/23/19, 01:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: December Kamil is happy too 💓
12/23/19, 01:29 - Sara: I thought it was going to be only a love affair
12/23/19, 01:29 - Sara: But nop, you are too cute for only having that relationship
12/23/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't even want a relationship, I assumed that it would be stupid on Erasmus, after all it's not so long and what to do after
12/23/19, 01:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: But in the end I was proven wrong and I'm glad that I was
12/23/19, 01:31 - Sara: After a 7-years relationship i wnated to try my sex appeal
12/23/19, 01:31 - Sara: And well
12/23/19, 01:32 - Sara: Knowing such a person in depth is a blessing 💕
12/23/19, 01:32 - Sara: Sorry 😋
12/23/19, 01:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: You're not really sorry xd
12/23/19, 01:33 - Sara: Nop 😁
12/23/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy mal
12/23/19, 01:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mala mujer 💋
12/23/19, 01:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 01:35 - Sara: What would have happened if we had never met?
12/23/19, 01:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would still be sad and depressed like before Erasmus probably
12/23/19, 01:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or maybe there would be someone else, who knows
12/23/19, 01:36 - Sara: Really you were like that before?
12/23/19, 01:36 - Sara: Like that bad?
12/23/19, 01:36 - Sara: Polish?
12/23/19, 01:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I went on Erasmus to change something because I was sick of my life so idk
12/23/19, 01:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whoever would want xd
12/23/19, 01:37 - Sara: As well
12/23/19, 01:37 - Sara: Damn, because you cannot choose xd
12/23/19, 01:37 - Sara: That sounded like
12/23/19, 01:37 - Sara: “Girls, come to me” xd
12/23/19, 01:37 - Sara: You have never given the step right?
12/23/19, 01:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Honestly, I was never even that interested
12/23/19, 01:38 - Sara: “Ugh, girls”
12/23/19, 01:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I had other interests but at some point I started feeling rather lonely
12/23/19, 01:38 - Sara: “Ugh, people”
12/23/19, 01:38 - Sara: Why? :(
12/23/19, 01:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, friends stop being enough at some point, I guess
12/23/19, 01:39 - Sara: You are not alone 💗
12/23/19, 01:39 - Sara: I understand
12/23/19, 01:40 - Sara: I hope I can make you feel that you are not alone
12/23/19, 01:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: You do ❤️
12/23/19, 01:40 - Sara: Not only as a couple, but as a friend
12/23/19, 01:41 - Sara: Or not only me, but others
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: 💋
12/23/19, 01:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, I have a more energy after the whole Erasmus experience and more will to act, in that sense, I think it is the biggest gift I got from all of this
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: That is great 💕
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: I don’t know what erasmus brought me
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: Well
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: Probably the biggest change in my life and in my persona
12/23/19, 01:42 - Sara: So yes, that is not bad
12/23/19, 01:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it made me want more and experience more which is good because it drives me forward, more than ever before
12/23/19, 01:44 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 01:44 - Sara: I agree
12/23/19, 01:44 - Sara: My country is small
12/23/19, 01:44 - Sara: God, and travelling a lot is a blessing
12/23/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pfff, Slovenia xd
12/23/19, 01:45 - Sara: Xddd
12/23/19, 01:45 - Sara: Even more xD
12/23/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: But living in a small country can be actually great, because visiting other neighborhing countries is quite easy
12/23/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like in Belgium
12/23/19, 01:47 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 01:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: From the middle of Poland or Spain, not so much
12/23/19, 01:47 - Sara: Not at all
12/23/19, 01:47 - Sara: Can we live in the centre of Europe? Xd
12/23/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already do xd
12/23/19, 01:48 - Sara: Real centre xd
12/23/19, 01:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Geographically, it's true xd
12/23/19, 01:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, near the centre
12/23/19, 01:50 - Sara: Buyu
12/23/19, 01:50 - Sara: Buuu
12/23/19, 01:50 - Sara: Not enough 4 traveling xd

12/23/19, 01:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dulces sueños

12/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 10:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 14:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Two sides of Sara 💋💋💋
12/23/19, 14:14 - Sara: 💋
12/23/19, 14:14 - Sara: How are you?
12/23/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok, feeling a bit lazy but I need to start doing something useful
12/23/19, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/23/19, 14:22 - Sara: Have ypu just waken up?
12/23/19, 14:22 - Sara: Studying
12/23/19, 14:22 - Sara: Phrasal verbs ugh
12/23/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, but I haven't really done much so far
12/23/19, 14:22 - Sara: What exactly?
12/23/19, 14:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not engineering, therefore terrible
12/23/19, 14:23 - Sara: Oh
12/23/19, 14:23 - Sara: So superior xd
12/23/19, 14:24 - Sara: At least i’m productive xd
12/23/19, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Obviously, nice that you finally noticed
12/23/19, 14:24 - Sara: Oh master
12/23/19, 14:24 - Sara: Saviours of the world
12/23/19, 14:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thank you, you're so kind 😘
12/23/19, 14:25 - Sara: Go and do sex toys
12/23/19, 14:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: They're not sex toys, they're FUCKING MACHINES
12/23/19, 14:27 - Sara: 🤔
12/23/19, 14:27 - Sara: Literally fucking you?
12/23/19, 14:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tickling you internally 🌚
12/23/19, 14:29 - Sara: 🌝
12/23/19, 14:29 - Sara: So perv
12/23/19, 14:29 - Sara: As the cardinal
12/23/19, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: How dare you, he's a holy man 😠
12/23/19, 14:30 - Sara: Not promoting fucking in out houses :(
12/23/19, 14:30 - Sara: Our*
12/23/19, 14:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 17:57 - Sara: Do I? :p
12/23/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🙄
12/23/19, 17:58 - Sara: A bit, right?
12/23/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
12/23/19, 17:58 - Sara: Hahaha sorry
12/23/19, 17:58 - Sara: But all the time?
12/23/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, most of the time you're not doing it, so idk
12/23/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I don't even like it that much
12/23/19, 17:59 - Sara: Ha ha ha
12/23/19, 17:59 - Sara: But
12/23/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: In general, I mean
12/23/19, 17:59 - Sara: Are you talking about... masturbation, right?
12/23/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes
12/23/19, 18:00 - Sara: Sorry :s
12/23/19, 18:00 - Sara: I didn’t know you don’t like it
12/23/19, 18:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it probably depends when and how you do it
12/23/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes you got sort of 'aggressive' with it
12/23/19, 18:01 - Sara: Ok
12/23/19, 18:01 - Sara: Why didn’t you tell me all this time? :s
12/23/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm just too slow, not your fault 💋
12/23/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it happened like once, it doesn't bother me particularly
12/23/19, 18:02 - Sara: Sure? :s
12/23/19, 18:02 - Sara: Now I’m worried
12/23/19, 18:02 - Sara: Slow in getting the orgasm?
12/23/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/23/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sex doesn't really worry me
12/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: I know
12/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: But doing something you were comfortable with...
12/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: I care :(
12/23/19, 18:03 - Sara: Sorry ><
12/23/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, the intentions were right, that's all that really matters to me
12/23/19, 18:04 - Sara: But... i was hurting you :(
12/23/19, 18:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: It wasn't hurting
12/23/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sadly, we do not get enough practice time together 😢
12/23/19, 18:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have a lot to learn too
12/23/19, 18:05 - Sara: True
12/23/19, 18:06 - Sara: Do I?
12/23/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if a lot, some things probably, there is always something to improve
12/23/19, 18:07 - Sara: What?
12/23/19, 18:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, masturbation for example
12/23/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was also thinking that we can probably learn to synchronize better during penetration, sometimes it doesn't work so well, but that's for both of us
12/23/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Synchronize movements I mean
12/23/19, 18:08 - Sara: True
12/23/19, 18:09 - Sara: But it is more difficult I guess
12/23/19, 18:09 - Sara: Idk if it is the same effect moving equally both or just going it one
12/23/19, 18:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Both ways is fine probably, I don't know if there is any significant difference
12/23/19, 18:10 - Sara: It is about trying
12/23/19, 18:10 - Sara: But do I do bad sex or something?
12/23/19, 18:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: I never said that, but in whatever I do, I always try to notice what can be done better, that's about it
12/23/19, 18:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So since I noticed some things, I tell you now, but overall I think it's quite great
12/23/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you have anything in mind that I should do better?
12/23/19, 18:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides oral, obviously
12/23/19, 18:13 - Sara: True
12/23/19, 18:13 - Sara: I don’t know. I’m afraid that I’m not good even enough even in sex or you don’t feel comfortable with me in that aspect :s
12/23/19, 18:14 - Sara: Maybe it’s a matter for both of us going slower
12/23/19, 18:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I suppose it's about trying and finding what works best
12/23/19, 18:15 - Sara: Like i connect more with what it is called “””””””preliminaries””””””””
12/23/19, 18:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
12/23/19, 18:15 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 18:16 - Sara: I like when we focus more the sex act in the massages... this kind of things
12/23/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok
12/23/19, 18:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Foreplay, it's called, I think
12/23/19, 18:17 - Sara: Probably
12/23/19, 18:17 - Sara: ^^
12/23/19, 18:17 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 18:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just like being close to you, if we manage to do something nice, even better 💋
12/23/19, 18:17 - Sara: :)
12/23/19, 18:17 - Sara: The same
12/23/19, 18:18 - Sara: Have I done something wrong?
12/23/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really
12/23/19, 18:18 - Sara: Do you like it with me?
12/23/19, 18:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course
12/23/19, 18:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why do you ask?
12/23/19, 18:19 - Sara: I don’t know, i’m starting to feel a little sad in case i’m not enough of something
12/23/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: You are quite enough ❤️
12/23/19, 18:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, I'm a bit slow, I don't know why, I've been thinking about it
12/23/19, 18:20 - Sara: I’ll try to do research
12/23/19, 18:20 - Sara: I felt weird when you told me i don’t know how to masturbate, tbh
12/23/19, 18:21 - Sara: But I guess it is about learning
12/23/19, 18:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe it's the condom and significantly less sensation because of it, maybe it's a mental blockade, or most likely a mix of both
12/23/19, 18:22 - Sara: Why mental blockade?
12/23/19, 18:22 - Sara: We can try without comdom
12/23/19, 18:22 - Sara: I’m a constant baby killer 😎
12/23/19, 18:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, compared to just masturbation alone, I guess I worry too much, overthink and it makes it more difficult I guess
12/23/19, 18:23 - Sara: Definitely
12/23/19, 18:23 - Sara: That happened (happens?) to me as well
12/23/19, 18:23 - Sara: Why you worry and overthink?
12/23/19, 18:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't want to dissapoint, you told me before that you used to be frustrated sexually, also sex requires significant physical effort which can be a bit distracting too
12/23/19, 18:25 - Sara: You shouldn’t care my previous sexual frustration
12/23/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I know what you will tell me, but in my mind, no matter what you say I still worry
12/23/19, 18:26 - Sara: It was other times and other people
12/23/19, 18:26 - Sara: My mind changed
12/23/19, 18:26 - Sara: I’ll prove it
12/23/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not so easy to get rid of these kinds of issues, sadly
12/23/19, 18:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably just takes time
12/23/19, 18:26 - Sara: I know
12/23/19, 18:27 - Sara: And about the physical thing, maybe I should do more
12/23/19, 18:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, as I said before, it's about trying, I suppose
12/23/19, 18:27 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 18:27 - Sara: How have you started thinking about this?
12/23/19, 18:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wasn't, I suppose that picture just started a conversation
12/23/19, 18:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I wasn't now
12/23/19, 18:30 - Sara: Sorry if it was my fault
12/23/19, 18:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: What was your fault?
12/23/19, 18:30 - Sara: In case you are concerned about this
12/23/19, 18:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't consider this to be anyone's fault
12/23/19, 18:31 - Sara: True
12/23/19, 18:31 - Sara: But in case you are sad or concerned now
12/23/19, 18:31 - Sara: I’m worried
12/23/19, 18:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, I'm sure we can figure things out, besides I told you before that sex doesn't worry me as long as you're satisfied
12/23/19, 18:32 - Sara: It is not only about satisfaction
12/23/19, 18:32 - Sara: Or my satisfaction xd
12/23/19, 18:33 - Sara: Why my satisfaction?
12/23/19, 18:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't want you to regret a closed relationship
12/23/19, 18:34 - Sara: Dime más
12/23/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's about it, since you are in one because of me, the least I can do is make it worth it
12/23/19, 18:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or at least try
12/23/19, 18:35 - Sara: Not really
12/23/19, 18:35 - Sara: Open relationships are not about sex
12/23/19, 18:35 - Sara: Closed relationships are not only about sex
12/23/19, 18:36 - Sara: It’s not your duty
12/23/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I know, but here we were talking specifically about sex
12/23/19, 18:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's why I phrased it like that
12/23/19, 18:36 - Sara: What is the most important thing for you in sex?
12/23/19, 18:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Being close with the person I love
12/23/19, 18:37 - Sara: Do you care about having orgasms?
12/23/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not particularly, but I guess you noticed that already
12/23/19, 18:38 - Sara: Of course
12/23/19, 18:38 - Sara: So why do you think I put emphasis on orgasms when I have sex?
12/23/19, 18:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was also worried that you were worried about me not having orgasms
12/23/19, 18:38 - Sara: I am
12/23/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which makes me worry more and be less likely to have one
12/23/19, 18:39 - Sara: Why
12/23/19, 18:39 - Sara: :(
12/23/19, 18:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because I worry that you worry that I worry
12/23/19, 18:40 - Sara: Is that bad that I want you to have an orgasm?
12/23/19, 18:40 - Sara: I don’t want to be selfish
12/23/19, 18:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: No, but I suppose putting emphasis on it results in some pressure that gives the opposite results, I guess
12/23/19, 18:41 - Sara: I’m not
12/23/19, 18:41 - Sara: Not on me
12/23/19, 18:42 - Sara: And it is said that stimulating penises are quite easy, and if i cannot do it i’m a problem
12/23/19, 18:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: On me, yes, I fully realize that you have best intentions, but then later every time, I try and I fail and I feel bad because I make you sad
12/23/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Apparently not so easy, mental state plays a huge role here
12/23/19, 18:43 - Sara: No, i’m not sad
12/23/19, 18:43 - Sara: I agree
12/23/19, 18:43 - Sara: Do not worry about me ❤
12/23/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: If it was only so simple
12/23/19, 18:44 - Sara: If I don’t worry, will you not be worried?
12/23/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Should be helpful, at least less worried
12/23/19, 18:45 - Sara: I’ll try
12/23/19, 18:45 - Sara: But it would be hard
12/23/19, 18:45 - Sara: I have always been a person who please people
12/23/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: The mindset I had in the last days in Spain was: I have to have it or she will be dissapointed (in herself, I guess) and sad, and I obviously didn't have it
12/23/19, 18:46 - Sara: :(
12/23/19, 18:46 - Sara: Sorry... 😭
12/23/19, 18:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not your fault, it's really sweet that you care so much, I just need to figure it out somehoe
12/23/19, 18:49 - Sara: Sorry, really ><
12/23/19, 18:49 - Sara: What exactly?
12/23/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: How to worry less, it's all about trust I suppose but it's tremendously difficult to believe that I'm not disappointing someone, self-esteem issues, I guess
12/23/19, 18:55 - Sara: I will help you
12/23/19, 18:55 - Sara: I swear
12/23/19, 18:56 - Sara: I guess mine are also self-esteem problems
12/23/19, 18:57 - Sara: And I don’t know, guys have always been the focus of sex
12/23/19, 18:59 - Sara: But trust is the key
12/23/19, 19:03 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 19:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you many times that I don't consider you selfish, but I understand, I  would have a hard time believing it too
12/23/19, 19:33 - Sara: You selfish?
12/23/19, 19:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, if I were you
12/23/19, 19:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not only with this particular statement, but any other
12/23/19, 19:39 - Sara: Yes
12/23/19, 19:40 - Sara: Sorry if that doesn’t let you enjoy sex :(
12/23/19, 19:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's not your fault
12/23/19, 19:41 - Sara: Thanks for understanding it
12/23/19, 19:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess I just need to get better at it so that I start to believe that I'm not disappointing
12/23/19, 19:42 - Sara: You will never be disappointing
12/23/19, 19:42 - Sara: It is about affection
12/23/19, 19:42 - Sara: Rather than a skill
12/23/19, 19:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, but somewhere in the back of my mind, there are still doubts about myself
12/23/19, 19:44 - Sara: Which ones?
12/23/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: That mostly
12/23/19, 19:50 - Sara: You should believe more in yourself
12/23/19, 19:50 - Sara: And like you
12/23/19, 19:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I could try to hate myself the least but that position is already occupied
12/23/19, 20:01 - Sara: There are two slots :)

12/23/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe you should be more Spanish and come later
12/23/19, 20:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🤔
12/23/19, 20:59 - Sara: As well
12/23/19, 20:59 - Sara: But i hate people not coming on timee
12/23/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: You live in Spain, that's part of the local religion xd
12/23/19, 21:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's basically a national identity matter
12/23/19, 21:00 - Sara: Ugh
12/23/19, 21:00 - Sara: I guess
12/23/19, 21:00 - Sara: But the appointment in the restaurant is at 9! XD
12/23/19, 21:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fine, I'll be there in 5 minutes
12/23/19, 21:02 - Sara: Take the fastest ship

12/23/19, 21:07 - Sara: Shit
12/23/19, 21:07 - Sara: At least it is not France
12/23/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, could be worse
12/23/19, 21:09 - Sara: You prefer Lisbon or Porto?
12/23/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I haven't been there yet so I don't know actually
12/23/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I definitely want to visit
12/23/19, 21:09 - Sara: Should I go to the restaurant?
12/23/19, 21:10 - Sara: I prefered Porto ^^
12/23/19, 21:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you can probably wait inside, why not
12/24/19, 03:02 - Sara: Already at home 🏡
12/24/19, 12:18 - Sara: Hope you have a good day of Christmas eve 💕
12/24/19, 12:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/ihW56Xa3XGQ

12/24/19, 12:21 - Sara: An n with an accent.... 🤔
12/24/19, 12:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Bien, un poco cansado pero bastante bien
12/24/19, 12:21 - Sara: Y eso?
12/24/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: No sé porque
12/24/19, 12:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Y tú?
12/24/19, 12:23 - Sara: Yo estoy bien
12/24/19, 12:23 - Sara: He estudiado un poco, pero no mucho
12/24/19, 12:23 - Sara: Ahora veré a mis amigos del instituto
12/24/19, 12:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Perdona, yo estudio español, yo escribo en español, tu estudias polaco, entonces, escribe en Polaco, hija de Paco 😾
12/24/19, 12:27 - Sara: No sé tanto polaco :(
12/24/19, 12:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/24/19, 12:31 - Sara: :(
12/24/19, 12:31 - Sara: Empecé hace poco :(
12/24/19, 12:32 - Sara: Stop bullying
12/24/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/8HVZ9JVKDi8
12/24/19, 12:38 - Sara: Why you bully me
12/24/19, 12:38 - Sara: Qué has hecho?
12/24/19, 12:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I bullied you
12/24/19, 12:40 - Sara: Xdddd
12/24/19, 12:40 - Sara: Ahora
12/24/19, 12:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: But let's be honest, you're spanish, you deserve it, almost as much as the french
12/24/19, 12:46 - Sara: Say it in Spanish 🤔
12/24/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Pero, vamos a ser sincero, eres española, lo mereces, casi tanto como los franceses
12/24/19, 12:48 - Sara: Ser sinceros*
12/24/19, 12:48 - Sara: Te lo mereces*
12/24/19, 12:48 - Sara: We can unite our strength againts the Frenchies
12/24/19, 12:48 - Sara: Think about that
12/24/19, 12:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Most likely you would just start some civil war, I am probably better off just bullying them on my own
12/24/19, 12:50 - Sara: Civil war with France? Xd
12/24/19, 12:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Civil War with me or something, I fully expect you to betray me and side with the french
12/24/19, 12:51 - Sara: Since when are you spanish? XD
12/24/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you proposed an alliance
12/24/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, maybe that doesn't count as civil war
12/24/19, 12:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: But close enough
12/24/19, 12:52 - Sara: Yep, I was concerned in that aspect
12/24/19, 12:52 - Sara: Si te encuentro, gritaré a viva voz. Que prefiero verte que ganar la guerra 🎶
12/24/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Levántate mi corazón 🎶
12/24/19, 12:53 - Sara: Oh, you know it
12/24/19, 12:53 - Sara: Hahaha
12/24/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I like it a lot
12/24/19, 12:54 - Sara: La Raiz are really nice ^^
12/24/19, 12:54 - Sara: What have you done?
12/24/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, recently I was going to sleep very late and yesterday I made an attempt to fix that but now I'm feeling quite tired because of that
12/24/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need to adjust, I suppose
12/24/19, 13:05 - Sara: So is it finished already?
12/24/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: What is finished?
12/24/19, 13:06 - Sara: Well
12/24/19, 13:06 - Sara: Fix the thesis I guess right?
12/24/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I'll take another look at it probably, but more or less, yes
12/24/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I need my promoter to see it, he will probably propose some more changes
12/24/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at least for now, more or less, done
12/24/19, 13:11 - Sara: Goof
12/24/19, 13:11 - Sara: Good
12/24/19, 13:11 - Sara: And what are you going to do during christmas?
12/24/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Other than dying at Christmas dinners?
12/24/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably the same as any other days, practice something, study something, waste a lot of time xd
12/24/19, 13:13 - Sara: ~sending nudes to Sara~
12/24/19, 13:13 - Sara: Why waste of time?
12/24/19, 13:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Where is my Santa hat?~
12/24/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always waste a lot of time, but hopefully, gradually I can be more productive
12/24/19, 13:14 - Sara: But it is also okay to relax
12/24/19, 13:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/24/19, 23:09 - Sara: Why?

12/25/19, 00:40 - Sara: But
12/25/19, 00:40 - Sara: Rumba related with anal sex? Xd
12/25/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Taki, taki rrrumba xd

12/25/19, 19:55 - Sara: It was nice
12/25/19, 19:55 - Sara: We ate too much

12/25/19, 19:58 - Sara: My sister said “””whispering””” oh, like ku klux klan xd
12/25/19, 19:58 - Sara: But we are good godmothers :p
12/25/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eeeh, so similar to my comments about church karaoke to my parents, nothing interesting
12/25/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dissapointed
12/25/19, 19:59 - Sara: Xdddd
12/25/19, 19:59 - Sara: We are a satanist family c’mone xD
12/25/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Low level satanism
12/25/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: You need to improve
12/25/19, 20:00 - Sara: True
12/25/19, 20:00 - Sara: Next time I can set myself on fire xd
12/25/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or better set the priest on fire
12/25/19, 20:06 - Sara: Better
12/25/19, 20:06 - Sara: 🔥
12/25/19, 20:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: One month to Cracow 💋
12/25/19, 20:13 - Sara: + 1 day

12/25/19, 20:18 - Sara: Bu
12/25/19, 20:18 - Sara: But yesss ♥
12/25/19, 20:18 - Sara: Yay
12/25/19, 20:18 - Sara: Have you planed something else?
12/25/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: A little bit but I will make more detailed plans a bit later probably
12/25/19, 20:19 - Sara: Great
12/25/19, 20:20 - Sara: Bring me warm cuddles and hoy chocolate ♥
12/25/19, 20:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was actually looking for something like the Arab baths xd
12/25/19, 20:23 - Sara: Tell me more 🌚
12/25/19, 20:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I found one, well, maybe it's more like saunas and stuff but you can only enter completely naked xd
12/25/19, 20:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So no thanks, not with you xd
12/25/19, 20:25 - Sara: Why? :(
12/25/19, 20:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not with the effect you typically have on me xddd
12/25/19, 20:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍆
12/25/19, 20:28 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 20:28 - Sara: Ha ha
12/25/19, 20:28 - Sara: You get horny because of me
12/25/19, 20:28 - Sara: Such a nerd
12/25/19, 20:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: So do you, but you're a cowardly woman and you don't show it so obviously xd
12/25/19, 20:30 - Sara: Not everytime people get naked I get excited xD
12/25/19, 20:30 - Sara: But obviously
12/25/19, 20:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, me neither, depends what we do specifically, like in the Arab bath 😏
12/25/19, 20:37 - Sara: 🌝
12/25/19, 20:38 - Sara: But you were really excited or it was because of the hot water?
12/25/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, I guess just being close does that, it doesn't even mean much, tbh
12/25/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: There is a spa with beer baths xd
12/25/19, 20:40 - Sara: Aw 💕
12/25/19, 20:41 - Sara: Dime más
12/25/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But it's just a spa and the bath lasts only 20 minutes
12/25/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: So unfortunately no pools or anything, it seems
12/25/19, 20:43 - Sara: Not too much time :(
12/25/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are very nice thermal baths near the mountains
12/25/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Cracow itself, not really
12/25/19, 20:43 - Sara: Mmmmm
12/25/19, 20:44 - Sara: Maybe other type of activities
12/25/19, 20:44 - Sara: ~Tequila shot man?~
12/25/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, I will take a look later
12/25/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, one that I mentioned, with the axe throwing can be fun xd
12/25/19, 20:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll make a list and we can discuss it later
12/25/19, 20:46 - Sara: Please hahhaa
12/25/19, 20:47 - Sara: That can be nice 💕
12/25/19, 20:47 - Sara: I hope we can call soon ^^
12/25/19, 20:47 - Sara: Tomorrow I’ll go to Toledo so ^^
12/25/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: End of Christmas?
12/25/19, 20:48 - Sara: No :(
12/25/19, 20:48 - Sara: I hace holidays until end of january
12/25/19, 20:48 - Sara: With exams in between xd
12/25/19, 20:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean Christmas dinners and stuff
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: Oh
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: Yee
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: Then new years eve, but that will be the 4 of us in Toledo
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: This could be us:
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 21:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 21:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: On new year's eve? Interesting plan 🤔
12/25/19, 21:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you really into this kind of stuff?
12/25/19, 21:06 - Sara: Not specially my thing
12/25/19, 21:06 - Sara: But I love them a lot for doing tat haha
12/25/19, 21:06 - Sara: Come come COME
12/25/19, 21:06 - Sara: Always it is nice to try xD
12/25/19, 21:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Who is that?
12/25/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Checking flights...
12/25/19, 21:07 - Sara: Who are they? Cara DeLevinge and Ashley Benson xD
12/25/19, 21:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: They are together? I have no clue who these people are xd
12/25/19, 21:08 - Sara: NO WAY
12/25/19, 21:08 - Sara: At least Cara
12/25/19, 21:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe Cara rings a bell, like an actress or something
12/25/19, 21:09 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 21:10 - Sara: Model mainly
12/25/19, 21:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: When we were discussing the trip you should've proposed the return date in January xd
12/25/19, 21:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was looking and I could actually come on 20th of January and return with you on 26th for 50 euro xd
12/25/19, 21:32 - Sara: But I have exams...
12/25/19, 21:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I just checked, I don't think it's actually a very good idea
12/25/19, 21:34 - Sara: If you could 🌝
12/25/19, 21:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, I can wait one month, I can wait 5 days longer
12/25/19, 21:34 - Sara: You’d do it xD
12/25/19, 21:34 - Sara: Xdddd
12/25/19, 21:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it's better to use that money for a later visit 💋
12/25/19, 21:35 - Sara: New country?
12/25/19, 21:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or just Madrid again, depends on our schedules, I guess
12/25/19, 21:35 - Sara: True
12/25/19, 21:35 - Sara: But i don’t mind travelling
12/25/19, 21:35 - Sara: Specially in summer ^^
12/25/19, 21:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 21:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Of course, but I don't want to wait that long 😋
12/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: True :V
12/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: :)
12/25/19, 21:37 - Sara: First, we should think in January 💗
12/25/19, 21:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I wouldn't mind to plan for the future too, but hopefully after January plenty of things will change
12/25/19, 21:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~Maybe I'll just be in Spain~
12/25/19, 21:39 - Sara: We hope
12/25/19, 21:39 - Sara: For the best:)
12/25/19, 21:40 - Sara: Cross fingers ^^
12/25/19, 21:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or you can go on Erasmus to Poland xd
12/25/19, 21:58 - Sara: As well
12/25/19, 21:58 - Sara: If I study the master
12/25/19, 21:59 - Sara: But i’d love to do erasmus internship
12/25/19, 23:01 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 23:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely, exactly the same 😊
12/25/19, 23:04 - Sara: Since when are you the witcher? :B
12/25/19, 23:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would be nice, witchers are infertile, so that's cool
12/25/19, 23:05 - Sara: Really?
12/25/19, 23:05 - Sara: Yasss
12/25/19, 23:05 - Sara: No patches anymore!
12/25/19, 23:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, cool cat eyes
12/25/19, 23:09 - Sara: Really?
12/25/19, 23:09 - Sara: How? 👀
12/25/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Witchers are mutants, they get plenty of cool abilities
12/25/19, 23:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also the process is super dangerous and most people die
12/25/19, 23:12 - Sara: Dime mas
12/25/19, 23:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Witchers were created with the help of magic and alchemy to fight against monsters that normal humans don't really stand a chance against
12/25/19, 23:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Children were taken to the Kaer Morhen castle and there the tests and finally the mutation was conducted by mages and the children that survived were trained in swordfighting, magic, making potions and similar stuff
12/25/19, 23:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Witchers are faster, they are immune to many poisons and illnesses, they have excellent sight, also in the dark but also because they are mutants they cannot have children
12/25/19, 23:16 - Sara: Damn
12/25/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, also they are seen as pariahs and most people hate them just because they are different, even though they risk their lives to solve their problems
12/25/19, 23:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: They are kind of like bounty hunters
12/25/19, 23:18 - Sara: That is so complex xD
12/25/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, in the books the problem of racism is very prevalent
12/25/19, 23:19 - Sara: From an anti-racist perspective?
12/25/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But here, instead of skin color, it's the actual race, so an elf, human, dwarf, witcher
12/25/19, 23:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, Geralt is not racist
12/25/19, 23:20 - Sara: Main protagonist?
12/25/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I suppose the writer's idea was to show racism as an awful, despicable behavior
12/25/19, 23:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: That is nice
12/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: Should I read the books?
12/25/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the first season on Netflix they also show queen Calanthe, I think you would like her
12/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: Why?
12/25/19, 23:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I personally like them, so if you have time, sure
12/25/19, 23:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would say she is a feminist, one of the few strong women in that world
12/25/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And it's pretty cool
12/25/19, 23:22 - Sara: Cool 😎
12/25/19, 23:22 - Sara: I was going to ask what she does
12/25/19, 23:22 - Sara: But no spoilers xd
12/25/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vikings? I haven't watched it
12/25/19, 23:23 - Sara: !!!! You should
12/25/19, 23:23 - Sara: I love that series a loooot
12/25/19, 23:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can also try to watch the Witcher
12/25/19, 23:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overall, it's not bad, it makes some changes compared to the book, but it's ok
12/25/19, 23:25 - Sara: Too many films and series to watch and no time 😭
12/25/19, 23:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I suppose they had a pretty limited budget so they had to tone down some of the cooler sequences
12/25/19, 23:26 - Sara: True
12/25/19, 23:26 - Sara: How is it going? What have you done?
12/25/19, 23:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: After we returned from the dinner, not that much, I looked at some stuff for the trip, as I mentioned before, rewatched la casa de papel a bit, I think it's a pretty nice exercise, and I read some stuff online, news, etc.
12/25/19, 23:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I didn't feel like doing much today
12/25/19, 23:29 - Sara: You have done a lot ^^
12/25/19, 23:29 - Sara: I have been most of the day with my family in the baptism and having lunch ^^
12/25/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: In Cuenca, right?
12/25/19, 23:30 - Sara: Yes
12/25/19, 23:30 - Sara: We spend one more night here and we go back to Toledo
12/25/19, 23:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you going to spend most of January in Toledo or will you go to Madrid?
12/25/19, 23:30 - Sara: Madrid
12/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: With all the exams i’ll stay there
12/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: Probably some weekends i’ll go to Toledo
12/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: Depending on how it is going
12/25/19, 23:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you have the schedule of the exams already?
12/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: Yep
12/25/19, 23:31 - Sara: Some months ago
12/25/19, 23:32 - Sara: 3 exams second week of january
12/25/19, 23:32 - Sara: 2 exams the third one
12/25/19, 23:32 - Sara: And last week in 🇵🇱 💗
12/25/19, 23:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: I thought you had 4 exams?
12/25/19, 23:33 - Sara: Wait
12/25/19, 23:33 - Sara: 2 as well haha
12/25/19, 23:33 - Sara: Thank God
12/25/19, 23:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 23:35 - Sara: XD
12/25/19, 23:35 - Sara: I want to write but idk if i’m inspired
12/25/19, 23:36 - Sara: I miss you
12/25/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I miss you toooooo
12/25/19, 23:36 - Sara: :,)
12/25/19, 23:36 - Sara: What are you doing now?
12/25/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm reading some simple Spanish texts, I felt like practicing that a bit
12/25/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: What does 'nada más' mean?
12/25/19, 23:37 - Sara: Nothing else
12/25/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, but does it have some other meaning as well?
12/25/19, 23:38 - Sara: Mmmm not really
12/25/19, 23:38 - Sara: Give me the context
12/25/19, 23:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: 'Nada más entrar por la puerta se ve al fondo la ventana que deja entrar una agradable luz.' because in that sentence that meaning doesn't make much sense
12/25/19, 23:38 - Sara: Aaah
12/25/19, 23:38 - Sara: In that sense it is like
12/25/19, 23:38 - Sara: Just after entering...
12/25/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: vale, gracias 😘
12/25/19, 23:40 - Sara: Nie ma za co ^^
12/25/19, 23:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy bien, Sara de Polonia 👌
12/25/19, 23:42 - Sara: Yayyy

12/25/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you doing?
12/25/19, 23:51 - Sara: Now we are relaxing
12/25/19, 23:51 - Sara: Watching some tv while revising polish
12/25/19, 23:51 - Sara: Not too much
12/25/19, 23:52 - Sara: I feel weird for not doing anything but... i need it xD
12/25/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's Christmas, I think it's ok xd
12/25/19, 23:52 - Sara: And not in Toledo so xd
12/25/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, you're revising the best language
12/25/19, 23:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's hardly nothing
12/25/19, 23:53 - Sara: Romanian?
12/25/19, 23:55 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/25/19, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: TV?
12/25/19, 23:59 - Sara: Yes
12/26/19, 00:00 - Sara: For that film we never finished :(
12/26/19, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fucking traitors and their Latin language
12/26/19, 00:00 - Sara: 😈
12/26/19, 00:00 - Sara: Fuck you slavic
12/26/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eh, you always think only about that, fine, I'm on my way...
12/26/19, 00:01 - Sara: HAHAHAHHA
12/26/19, 00:01 - Sara: Kamil: Sara is thinking all the time about sex
12/26/19, 00:01 - Sara: Also Kamil: let’s have sex xd
12/26/19, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, since you already mentioned it anyway...
12/26/19, 00:02 - Sara: Always so perv xd
12/26/19, 00:03 - Sara: If you think i’m monothematic just tell me haha
12/26/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's a joke now, it will be much nicer when we're in the same city 😉
12/26/19, 00:04 - Sara: ;)
12/26/19, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Won't be a joke anymore...
12/26/19, 00:05 - Sara: That’s it
12/26/19, 00:05 - Sara: But
12/26/19, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: This is where things get serious
12/26/19, 00:05 - Sara: Satisfyer > Kamil
12/26/19, 00:05 - Sara: Xdddd
12/26/19, 00:05 - Sara: Why?

12/26/19, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/26/19, 00:06 - Sara: That is better
12/26/19, 00:06 - Sara: Malas noticias :(
12/26/19, 00:06 - Sara: I love yuuuu
12/26/19, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Who is 'yu' ? Do I know him? WIFE, ARE YOU CHEATING ON ME?
12/26/19, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: (Insert andraž video)
12/26/19, 00:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/26/19, 00:08 - Sara: Obviously
12/26/19, 00:08 - Sara: YES
12/26/19, 00:08 - Sara: *HARDER*
12/26/19, 00:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: #Llorando 😓
12/26/19, 00:10 - Sara: :P
12/26/19, 00:10 - Sara: Seriously
12/26/19, 00:11 - Sara: Te quiero
12/26/19, 00:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lo sé ❤️
12/26/19, 00:11 - Sara: I just want to make sure
12/26/19, 00:11 - Sara: I have been thinking about you a lot
12/26/19, 00:11 - Sara: Specially today
12/26/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
12/26/19, 00:12 - Sara: Just I like being with you
12/26/19, 00:12 - Sara: And spending time together is nice
12/26/19, 00:12 - Sara: And idk, this familiar meetings with my partner is also cool
12/26/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm glad that you recorded some videos during the trip, I watch them when I'm sad ❤️
12/26/19, 00:12 - Sara: Are you sad?
12/26/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not now
12/26/19, 00:13 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/26/19, 00:13 - Sara: Sure?
12/26/19, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/26/19, 00:13 - Sara: Madrid trip you mean?
12/26/19, 00:13 - Sara: I like watching them as well
12/26/19, 00:14 - Sara: That is the reason why I recorded them
12/26/19, 00:14 - Sara: And you telling me off xd
12/26/19, 00:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: The last one with borracha Muchacha is nice xd
12/26/19, 00:14 - Sara: Which video is that one?
12/26/19, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Last night in Madrid, I think, you ask me to stay until March 💋
12/26/19, 00:16 - Sara: Aw heart
12/26/19, 00:16 - Sara: I’ll try to find it
12/26/19, 00:16 - Sara: I don’t remember it haha
12/26/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/26/19, 00:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I think you recorded it after the shot bar xd
12/26/19, 00:17 - Sara: It’s at the end hahaha
12/26/19, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been thinking about my favorite moment of that trip and I'm not sure which one I liked the most
12/26/19, 00:17 - Sara: Tell me
12/26/19, 00:17 - Sara: ^^
12/26/19, 00:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe 'resting' before Tortilla in Toledo 💋
12/26/19, 00:18 - Sara: “”””resting””””
12/26/19, 00:18 - Sara: Why that one?
12/26/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it was a bit different than usual, intimate, quiet, Idk, I just liked it a lot
12/26/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also the boat was great
12/26/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And the pool bar
12/26/19, 00:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And the Arab bath
12/26/19, 00:19 - Sara: I agree
12/26/19, 00:19 - Sara: In all of them
12/26/19, 00:20 - Sara: But i have to admit i didn’t think about this one
12/26/19, 00:20 - Sara: I loved when we were watching Coco
12/26/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: As well ❤️
12/26/19, 00:20 - Sara: It was beautiful spending time with you like that
12/26/19, 00:20 - Sara: Sometimes I prefer that to sex
12/26/19, 00:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the sex category, it was my favorite, overall, I'm not sure, there are many
12/26/19, 00:21 - Sara: But because it was unexpected and dangerous? Xd
12/26/19, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Rather just how it turned out specifically, it was slower than usual, we didn't even undress, Idk, it was just something different
12/26/19, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not necessarily doing it all the time like that, but sometimes it can be quite nice
12/26/19, 00:24 - Sara: True
12/26/19, 00:24 - Sara: I like when sex is not planned
12/26/19, 00:24 - Sara: Just as it happens :)
12/26/19, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was quite cool, just adapting to the current environment, being more careful, not planning anything
12/26/19, 00:25 - Sara: Yes 💕
12/26/19, 00:25 - Sara: I think we get nervious when we have sex because we want everything perfect
12/26/19, 00:25 - Sara: And well, what is perfect? XD
12/26/19, 00:26 - Sara: We have to work on that
12/26/19, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, agreed
12/26/19, 00:27 - Sara: Do you think we need more communication?
12/26/19, 00:27 - Sara: In sex and in general
12/26/19, 00:28 - Sara: I’ll try to repeat to you that everything is going to be okay 💗
12/26/19, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mmm, Idk, I mean, it's always a good thing to do, so perhaps?
12/26/19, 00:29 - Sara: Well, of course
12/26/19, 00:29 - Sara: But my question was about whether if we need improvement
12/26/19, 00:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, it's rather difficult to judge, I suppose
12/26/19, 00:30 - Sara: True
12/26/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: In general, seems ok, in sex, probably could be better
12/26/19, 00:31 - Sara: But well, do you think I express everything?
12/26/19, 00:31 - Sara: Agree 👍
12/26/19, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think so, I don't feel like I lack some knowledge, I suppose
12/26/19, 00:32 - Sara: Not sure?
12/26/19, 00:32 - Sara: Okay ^^
12/26/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if I don't know if I don't know something important xd
12/26/19, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope not
12/26/19, 00:32 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/26/19, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, that 'if' shouldn't be there
12/26/19, 00:34 - Sara: As well
12/26/19, 00:34 - Sara: I just wanted to talk about us as a couple
12/26/19, 00:34 - Sara: We were starting to be more intimate in the conversation
12/26/19, 00:34 - Sara: And idk why conversations are more honest at night
12/26/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for the previous question, my opinion is that
12/26/19, 00:35 - Sara: Okay 💕
12/26/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's at least how I feel it at the moment
12/26/19, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/26/19, 00:35 - Sara: Communication in us or in you?
12/26/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: This
12/26/19, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: And this
12/26/19, 00:37 - Sara: I think we communicate things tight. Maybe in thre emotional you tend to close, and me to exaggerate everything
12/26/19, 00:37 - Sara: Depending on the topic I guess
12/26/19, 00:37 - Sara: And also I like expressing everything, maybe for you not too much
12/26/19, 00:37 - Sara: And that is nice
12/26/19, 00:38 - Sara: I remember the conversation about saying “i love you”
12/26/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do tend to express mostly what I consider important, that is true, but I also like that you express more, so that is quite nice for me
12/26/19, 00:39 - Sara: Dime más
12/26/19, 00:39 - Sara: Expressing more about what?
12/26/19, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Anything, like you said here
12/26/19, 00:40 - Sara: Ahhh
12/26/19, 00:40 - Sara: I thought that you said to me I should express more
12/26/19, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, similarly to how you tell me literally everything you did in a day and I just list the most important things, different ways but both are fine, I think
12/26/19, 00:41 - Sara: True
12/26/19, 00:41 - Sara: I hope not to be annoying with that
12/26/19, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, as I said, for me it's quite nice actually
12/26/19, 00:42 - Sara: Thanks ;)
12/26/19, 00:42 - Sara: If i say things that are not interesting or important just tell me
12/26/19, 00:42 - Sara: I like talking witg you about everything in my head
12/26/19, 00:42 - Sara: I feel comfortable and you are a good adviser
12/26/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: That is perfectly fine for me, it's nice that you feel that way
12/26/19, 00:44 - Sara: I hope the same
12/26/19, 00:45 - Sara: Like i want you to open little by little and not forced
12/26/19, 00:45 - Sara: They are little steps
12/26/19, 00:46 - Sara: In my case i’m afraid of repeating the same things
12/26/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, even if it happens sometimes, it's not really a problem
12/26/19, 00:48 - Sara: Why are u so cute
12/26/19, 00:48 - Sara: Thanks for understanding me
12/26/19, 00:48 - Sara: I’ll try to help you as good as possible
12/26/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: 💋
12/26/19, 00:49 - Sara: 💋
12/26/19, 00:49 - Sara: Anything to say? Something that worries you or is in your mind?
12/26/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing in particular at the moment
12/26/19, 00:51 - Sara: Nice
12/26/19, 00:52 - Sara: I have these days in mind all the insecurities about my body and what I eat
12/26/19, 00:52 - Sara: It is weird
12/26/19, 00:53 - Sara: I see famous people’s photos and their bodies, and I feel different
12/26/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you told you made some steps towards improving that lately so it's not so weird that the topic is on your mind
12/26/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I wouldn't compare to any pictures of famous people
12/26/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or not so famous, like on Instagram, for example
12/26/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because that's most of the time not how they actually look
12/26/19, 00:54 - Sara: Like weighting myself, writing all what I eat, “forcing” me to do exercise... is making me feel better or more obsessed
12/26/19, 00:54 - Sara: Yes and no, I guess
12/26/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: The guy who played the Witcher in the series said that he had that look only for a few days and he had to stop drinking water for three days to reach it
12/26/19, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: So that's quite bullshit
12/26/19, 00:55 - Sara: Definitely
12/26/19, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know if obsessed is the right word, focusing on some new goal is not really a bad thing
12/26/19, 00:56 - Sara: Obsessed in the bad sense I mean
12/26/19, 00:57 - Sara: But yes
12/26/19, 00:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I have one rule, I try to do only the things I want to do, but these things are not necessarily things that I enjoy
12/26/19, 00:58 - Sara: Also my sister has been receiving a lot of commebts because she has lost a lot of weight
12/26/19, 00:58 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/26/19, 00:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you said you force yourself to exercise
12/26/19, 00:59 - Sara: Well
12/26/19, 00:59 - Sara: I like it
12/26/19, 00:59 - Sara: I think you are not understanding me
12/26/19, 00:59 - Sara: XD
12/26/19, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: In that sense, for me, exercising or studying is something that I want to do because of the nice results I can get but it's not really something I enjoy doing that much
12/26/19, 01:00 - Sara: Okay, yes
12/26/19, 01:00 - Sara: I thought you liked sports
12/26/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sports, yes, I meant more like gym or something
12/26/19, 01:01 - Sara: Oh okay
12/26/19, 01:02 - Sara: I meant a completely thing different about all of this
12/26/19, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dime
12/26/19, 01:02 - Sara: Xd
12/26/19, 01:03 - Sara: Obsession with physical appearance, weight, insecurities
12/26/19, 01:03 - Sara: That is not good xd
12/26/19, 01:04 - Sara: Controlling what I eat, thoughts about fasting
12/26/19, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, what do you mean with obsession?
12/26/19, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's not necessarily bad, it can become bad if you overdo it and become anorectic or something
12/26/19, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, without paying attention to that it's kind of hard to get any results
12/26/19, 01:05 - Sara: I expected more a “focus more on your mental health” but fine
12/26/19, 01:05 - Sara: Hahah
12/26/19, 01:05 - Sara: Okay
12/26/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, that is obvious, we just kind of focused on that in the conversation so I didn't want to diverge to much
12/26/19, 01:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, focusing on a physical aspect can be good for mental aspect too
12/26/19, 01:07 - Sara: Mmmmm
12/26/19, 01:07 - Sara: I don’t know what to think
12/26/19, 01:08 - Sara: Well, I just wanted some support
12/26/19, 01:08 - Sara: But also I should consider your advices
12/26/19, 01:08 - Sara: I think i’m going to sleep
12/26/19, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, of course, I told you that if I notice that you go too far I will tell you
12/26/19, 01:09 - Sara: Thanks ^^
12/26/19, 01:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, at least for me, when I felt poorly, exercising, running, just working on my body was helpful
12/26/19, 01:10 - Sara: I’m starting to overthink xD
12/26/19, 01:10 - Sara: I should go to bed
12/26/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Umm, ok, but if you want to say something, go ahead
12/26/19, 01:11 - Sara: I feel sad xD
12/26/19, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
12/26/19, 01:11 - Sara: But I prefer going to bes
12/26/19, 01:11 - Sara: Bed
12/26/19, 01:12 - Sara: Better to talk tomorrow
12/26/19, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, I won't push you
12/26/19, 01:12 - Sara: Thanks
12/26/19, 01:12 - Sara: I’m okay
12/26/19, 01:12 - Sara: Just maybe I expected other comments, but what I do is stupid xD
12/26/19, 01:13 - Sara: I’m an idiot 😂
12/26/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as I said, it was a conversation about the physical aspect so I tried to stay on that topic, mental health obviously takes first place
12/26/19, 01:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although these aspects are not entirely separate
12/26/19, 01:14 - Sara: I guess
12/26/19, 01:15 - Sara: Idk
12/26/19, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yay, another person for the #delatorrism club 😊
12/26/19, 01:15 - Sara: Why?
12/26/19, 01:15 - Sara: I’m feeling confused
12/26/19, 01:15 - Sara: I should sleep
12/26/19, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Up to you, I'm here if you want
12/26/19, 01:16 - Sara: Good night Kamil
12/26/19, 01:16 - Sara: Do not worry
12/26/19, 01:16 - Sara: I want to express it
12/26/19, 01:16 - Sara: But i find it useless i guess
12/26/19, 01:17 - Sara: Amd if i want to hear something, i won’t force people to say it
12/26/19, 01:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not sure if I understand
12/26/19, 01:18 - Sara: I commented this because I wanted support
12/26/19, 01:18 - Sara: And maybe you are telling me other kind of comments that I didn’t expect
12/26/19, 01:18 - Sara: That are also fine
12/26/19, 01:18 - Sara: But at the same time are like
12/26/19, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you have it, I guess I just in my typical fashion started looking for advices and suggestions, sorry
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: Oh, i’m feeling bad with my body and this can become an obsession. Why is he telling me to continue? XD
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: It is okay
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: I won’t do that again
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: Rather i’d say
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: I feel fucking bad with my body during this time and I’m worried about getting obsessed with that
12/26/19, 01:19 - Sara: Amd that is
12/26/19, 01:20 - Sara: Sorry, i’m spoilt i guess
12/26/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I told you
12/26/19, 01:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I said that before too, I understand how it can become a problem
12/26/19, 01:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at the same time, I don't think it's something to worry about at the very beginning, because it can be very discouraging and prevent you from reaching your goals
12/26/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you have enough wisdom and will power to control yourself
12/26/19, 01:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But obviously I'll be there for you as well
12/26/19, 01:24 - Sara: Thanks :)
12/26/19, 01:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I do consider your goals to be a very good idea that will benefit you in many ways, also mental so I support all of this very, very much
12/26/19, 01:24 - Sara: 💕
12/26/19, 01:25 - Sara: Thanks
12/26/19, 01:25 - Sara: I’m a little bit afraid
12/26/19, 01:25 - Sara: Good night
12/26/19, 01:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just paying some attention to what you eat, exercising and checking your weight from time to time is not an obsession, in my opinion
12/26/19, 01:26 - Sara: Obsession is not the means but the result I think
12/26/19, 01:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I suppose there is a thin line between making an effort to stay healthy and being obsessed about it
12/26/19, 01:28 - Sara: True
12/26/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as I said, I'll pay attention to that, and if I'm worried about something, I'll say it
12/26/19, 01:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's what I can do, I suppose
12/26/19, 01:28 - Sara: Thanks
12/26/19, 01:28 - Sara: 💗
12/26/19, 01:29 - Sara: Probably, but that it is a lot
12/26/19, 01:29 - Sara: Don’t pay too much attention
12/26/19, 01:30 - Sara: I shouldn’t depend that much on people I guess
12/26/19, 01:30 - Sara: Sorry
12/26/19, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think it will be important to set some reasonable limits and it should be fine

12/26/19, 15:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: The cat was also from some uncle, if I remember correctly
12/26/19, 15:54 - Sara: True

12/26/19, 15:59 - Sara: Only a baby
12/26/19, 15:59 - Sara: Yayyyy ♥
12/26/19, 15:59 - Sara: You are also a baby 👶
12/26/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems about right since I hate children 👌
12/26/19, 16:19 - Sara: Also we can have other kind of babies :2
12/26/19, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: That can also be a bit of a problem, especially for traveling
12/26/19, 16:31 - Sara: True:(
12/26/19, 16:31 - Sara: Sad :(
12/26/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I wonder how you can transport a cat or a dog to another country
12/26/19, 16:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it possible to take it on the plane? Probably not, right?
12/26/19, 16:38 - Sara: Yep
12/26/19, 16:38 - Sara: But I find it cruel
12/26/19, 16:38 - Sara: Just like another luggage

12/27/19, 12:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: XD

12/27/19, 12:29 - Sara: How are you?
12/27/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine, nothing unusual so far
12/27/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/27/19, 12:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: How was yesterday?
12/27/19, 12:31 - Sara: It was nice
12/27/19, 12:31 - Sara: It is true that at the beginning I still had the breakdown and some actions affected to increase
12/27/19, 12:31 - Sara: But we had so much fun
12/27/19, 12:32 - Sara: I won one play of pool 🌚
12/27/19, 12:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/27/19, 12:33 - Sara: Because Christian put the black ball inside haha
12/27/19, 12:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's a win anyway xd
12/27/19, 12:33 - Sara: But it is true that both were only eith the black one
12/27/19, 12:33 - Sara: As well haha
12/27/19, 12:34 - Sara: What did you do?
12/27/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not much, in the end I didn't feel like
12/27/19, 12:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Today should be better
12/27/19, 12:35 - Sara: Oh
12/27/19, 12:35 - Sara: You can do it today ^^
12/27/19, 12:35 - Sara: I want to talk with you about something, but idk if later because i’m studying
12/27/19, 12:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Whenever you want, fine for me
12/27/19, 12:36 - Sara: Okay ^^ maybe later
12/27/19, 12:36 - Sara: What are you doing now?
12/27/19, 12:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, nothing right now
12/27/19, 12:37 - Sara: Then study right,
12/27/19, 12:37 - Sara: ?
12/27/19, 12:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you tell me a general topic at least?
12/27/19, 12:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably, yup
12/27/19, 12:37 - Sara: Sleeping with others
12/27/19, 12:40 - Sara: But i can talk about that now if you want
12/27/19, 12:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: No difference
12/27/19, 12:42 - Sara: Okay
12/27/19, 13:55 - Sara: It is just mentioning that when I meet Christian we normally sleep together for 1 hour or something like that (yesterday was like a kind of plan, but in general it is because I’m usually tired and I don’t plan it)
12/27/19, 13:56 - Sara: And yesterday you came into the conversation and well, true that we talked about this
12/27/19, 13:56 - Sara: But I think this is the first time I sleep with Christian and we are a couple
12/27/19, 17:11 - Sara: I hope you are okay
12/27/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, thanks
12/27/19, 17:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/27/19, 17:29 - Sara: Well, more or less
12/27/19, 17:29 - Sara: Trying to be distracted
12/27/19, 17:29 - Sara: Doing exercise
12/27/19, 17:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Distracted from what?
12/27/19, 17:31 - Sara: Something happened?
12/27/19, 17:31 - Sara: Negative thoughts I guess
12/27/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me
12/27/19, 17:32 - Sara: I’m afraid of losing friends
12/27/19, 17:32 - Sara: Or having already lost them
12/27/19, 17:32 - Sara: Specially the one Guada is in
12/27/19, 17:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mutual friends?
12/27/19, 17:33 - Sara: Yes, the same friend group
12/27/19, 17:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something happened?
12/27/19, 17:34 - Sara: The break up
12/27/19, 17:34 - Sara: Maybe afraid of meeting them
12/27/19, 17:35 - Sara: Most of the times Guada wasn’t there
12/27/19, 17:35 - Sara: But I feel like an outsider
12/27/19, 17:35 - Sara: And i don’t know if it is my fault
12/27/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: How often do you meet?
12/27/19, 17:36 - Sara: Not too much
12/27/19, 17:36 - Sara: From time to time
12/27/19, 17:36 - Sara: I feel comfortable when my sister is in it
12/27/19, 17:36 - Sara: Also with Guada when we were a couple
12/27/19, 17:36 - Sara: So idk
12/27/19, 17:37 - Sara: I’ll meet them tomorrow
12/27/19, 17:37 - Sara: Probably i’ll tell them
12/27/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: So are they really your friends or you were always just a plus one for someone else in that group?
12/27/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, that's probably the best solution
12/27/19, 17:38 - Sara: I don’t know
12/27/19, 17:38 - Sara: I don’t know
12/27/19, 17:38 - Sara: I feel alone sometimes
12/27/19, 17:38 - Sara: In friend groups
12/27/19, 17:39 - Sara: Maybe it is something stupid idk
12/27/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, best thing you can do about it is talking with them, I suppose
12/27/19, 17:40 - Sara: True
12/27/19, 17:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Overthinking it now won't really lead you anywhere
12/27/19, 17:40 - Sara: As well
12/27/19, 17:40 - Sara: Idk if this whole situation changed me that much
12/27/19, 17:41 - Sara: I’m afraid of people forgetting about me
12/27/19, 17:41 - Sara: Or being influenced by what happened with Guada
12/27/19, 17:41 - Sara: Or by him
12/27/19, 17:41 - Sara: But anyway
12/27/19, 17:41 - Sara: Have you read what I wrote?
12/27/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes
12/27/19, 17:42 - Sara: And something to say?
12/27/19, 17:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you expect me to say, do what you want
12/27/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I already said that I'm not going to tell what to do and what not to do
12/27/19, 17:43 - Sara: Mmmmmm
12/27/19, 17:43 - Sara: But... we were talking about that
12/27/19, 17:43 - Sara: And I care about your comfortability
12/27/19, 17:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
12/27/19, 17:44 - Sara: ?
12/27/19, 17:44 - Sara: If you have to say something, say it
12/27/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't have anything to say, you're an adult and I have no interest in policing your life in any way
12/27/19, 17:46 - Sara: But
12/27/19, 17:46 - Sara: We need to be responsible with our couple
12/27/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: So do what you want, if you want to be responsible, than be, I don't want to give you a set of rules to follow, that would be ridiculous
12/27/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I'll do my best to actually practice what I preach and not try to control anything, even accidentally
12/27/19, 17:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: I respect you and I'm not going to diminish you like that
12/27/19, 17:49 - Sara: Sure is it okay?
12/27/19, 17:49 - Sara: I receive bad vibes idk
12/27/19, 17:50 - Sara: I want communication
12/27/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I felt very ridiculous when some months ago we were talking about what is ok and what is not, what would be allowed and what would be not
12/27/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not to mention that I was immensely unhappy in that time
12/27/19, 17:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's not exactly pleasant for me
12/27/19, 17:51 - Sara: Oh
12/27/19, 17:51 - Sara: Sorry
12/27/19, 17:52 - Sara: I just wanted to be honest and share as much as possible
12/27/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, thank you
12/27/19, 17:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I won't tell you what to do
12/27/19, 17:53 - Sara: But i want what I should do for my partner being okay as well
12/27/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I figure that out on my own, you don't really need to tell me to do something or not (unless I make a mistake, I suppose)
12/27/19, 17:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, I don't feel good about telling you how to behave
12/27/19, 17:55 - Sara: Okay
12/27/19, 17:55 - Sara: Sorry
12/27/19, 17:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I respect you and treat you equally, I don't like being said what I can and what I cannot do, and from what I've seen so far, it seems that so do you
12/27/19, 17:56 - Sara: But
12/27/19, 17:56 - Sara: We are in a couple
12/27/19, 17:57 - Sara: But okay
12/27/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know you enough to know what to do
12/27/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, probably not everything
12/27/19, 17:57 - Sara: I trust you will tell me if you don’t like something or you feel uncomfortable
12/27/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: But I'm learning
12/27/19, 17:58 - Sara: The same
12/27/19, 17:58 - Sara: But idk if there is something further or... idk
12/27/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, fair enough, the situation you described doesn't exactly fill me with joy, but it's none of my business what you do with your friends and I won't prohibit you from anything
12/27/19, 17:59 - Sara: Do you want me to change something?
12/27/19, 18:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk
12/27/19, 18:02 - Sara: This message was deleted
12/27/19, 18:05 - Sara: Sorry
12/27/19, 18:05 - Sara: I won’t force the conversation
12/27/19, 18:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I trust you and that's enough for me, I think you're wise enough to navigate this so that it works out for everyone involved
12/27/19, 18:07 - Sara: Okay
12/27/19, 18:07 - Sara: I just care about you
12/27/19, 18:08 - Sara: In my case I’d share what I’m not comfortable with
12/27/19, 18:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I told you, I guess
12/27/19, 18:10 - Sara: Okay
12/27/19, 18:10 - Sara: Again, what do you want me to do?
12/27/19, 18:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, why do you need me to tell you that?
12/27/19, 18:11 - Sara: For you being okay
12/27/19, 18:32 - Sara: Well
12/27/19, 18:32 - Sara: Changing topic
12/27/19, 18:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/27/19, 18:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/27/19, 18:32 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/27/19, 18:33 - Sara: But please, don't end an important conversation like that next time
12/27/19, 18:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: I made my point several times and you kept pressing, I refuse to set any rules, I told you that it makes me feel ridiculous, I simply do things based on common sense (sometimes I don't but that's because I'm stupid and I don't always think before I say some shit, I'm trying to improve that)
12/27/19, 18:41 - Sara: Fair enough
12/27/19, 18:41 - Sara: I want that as well
12/27/19, 18:41 - Sara: But I feel something
12/27/19, 18:42 - Sara: Like idk if you are okay or not and you are hiding it
12/27/19, 18:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think we had enough conversations to more or less know our boundaries, I suppose, I really don't like talking about that
12/27/19, 18:43 - Sara: Sorry
12/27/19, 18:43 - Sara: I only wanted our relation to improve
12/27/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, you don't need to apologize all the time
12/27/19, 18:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: By setting some sort of rules?
12/27/19, 18:44 - Sara: I feel sad, that is why I apologize
12/27/19, 18:44 - Sara: By telling you my things
12/27/19, 18:45 - Sara: And making sure you are ok with that
12/27/19, 18:46 - Sara: Sorry if I care too much
12/27/19, 18:46 - Sara: I didn’t know it was going to be that damaging
12/27/19, 18:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just thought that you knew me enough to not have to ask about that anymore
12/27/19, 18:47 - Sara: Okay sorry
12/27/19, 18:47 - Sara: I’m knowing you
12/27/19, 18:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, I don't want to tell you how to behave, because you are Sara, my partner and not my child, I respect you and I think it wouldn't be right for me to do that
12/27/19, 18:48 - Sara: Yes
12/27/19, 18:49 - Sara: I perfectly know that
12/27/19, 18:49 - Sara: But you also have your right to be okay with me and not to be hurt with behaviour you don’t like
12/27/19, 18:49 - Sara: Or you don’t find appropriate
12/27/19, 18:49 - Sara: Maybe i won’t change , maybe yes if necessary
12/27/19, 18:49 - Sara: But it is important to know
12/27/19, 18:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: I trust my partner to not hurt me on purpose, I certainly make effort not to do that to you
12/27/19, 18:50 - Sara: The same
12/27/19, 18:50 - Sara: But idk, i don’t want you to have your own battle
12/27/19, 18:51 - Sara: I used to have it
12/27/19, 18:51 - Sara: And that is shit
12/27/19, 18:51 - Sara: If something happens, it is better to share it and deal with it together
12/27/19, 18:51 - Sara: Maybe i’m caring too much
12/27/19, 18:54 - Sara: Sorry, I feel so embarrassed
12/27/19, 18:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
12/27/19, 18:54 - Sara: Idk, just making so much effort in nothing I guess
12/27/19, 18:55 - Sara: Worrying
12/27/19, 18:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I appreciate that you tell me your things and you don't hide anything
12/27/19, 18:56 - Sara: But i’m annoying 😞
12/27/19, 18:58 - Sara: I didn’t mean to underestimate you
12/27/19, 18:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm honestly rather surprised by your tone in this conversation, I didn't expect you to even ask what I want in this situation, at least based on past, but I suppose you did said that you're different
12/27/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: More visible than before, it seems
12/27/19, 18:59 - Sara: Is that bad?
12/27/19, 18:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, I don't think so
12/27/19, 19:00 - Sara: So what happened?
12/27/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said, I appreciate this
12/27/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: But also this
12/27/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: This
12/27/19, 19:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: And ultimately this
12/27/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do believe that you should make your own decisions
12/27/19, 19:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Big or small
12/27/19, 19:02 - Sara: So
12/27/19, 19:02 - Sara: If I sleep more times with others, there would be consequences?
12/27/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just do what you believe is the right thing to do
12/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: For me can be nice
12/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: For you not
12/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: Vice versa
12/27/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you even mean by sleep with others?
12/27/19, 19:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not going to threaten you, come on
12/27/19, 19:03 - Sara: .
12/27/19, 19:04 - Sara: I don’t know
12/27/19, 19:04 - Sara: I hope not
12/27/19, 19:05 - Sara: It is weird
12/27/19, 19:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: I do what I think is right, if I fuck up I apologize and learn from my mistakes, hopefully I'll be smart enough not to do anything that cannot be fixed, as I said, in most cases it's just common sense and what I know about you
12/27/19, 19:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I really don't want to tell you what is right, who am I to tell that to anyone
12/27/19, 19:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have to say that I really didn't expect that you would be unhappy with me telling you to follow your heart, telling you what to do reminds me of our worst moments and I don't want to go back to that time
12/27/19, 19:15 - Sara: The same
12/27/19, 19:15 - Sara: Of course not
12/27/19, 19:15 - Sara: You are not my master
12/27/19, 19:15 - Sara: But you are my couple
12/27/19, 19:15 - Sara: I care
12/27/19, 19:16 - Sara: I don’t want to hide things that could be “””problematic”””” or can concern us
12/27/19, 19:16 - Sara: Sorry
12/27/19, 19:16 - Sara: I’m not unhappy for that
12/27/19, 19:17 - Sara: I’m unhappy because maybe I hurt you
12/27/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: So do I and I respect you and trust you enough to just tell you to do what you think is right for you
12/27/19, 19:17 - Sara: Thanks
12/27/19, 19:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or for us, however you want to look at it
12/27/19, 19:17 - Sara: But this case wasn’t right for you
12/27/19, 19:18 - Sara: I’m in that dilemma
12/27/19, 19:18 - Sara: Idk I work different, like you can do whatever I want
12/27/19, 19:19 - Sara: But i’m careful because our perception of couple is different
12/27/19, 19:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, there is nothing wrong about having a nap before going out
12/27/19, 19:19 - Sara: True
12/27/19, 19:19 - Sara: But you wasn’t happy
12/27/19, 19:20 - Sara: That is why I care
12/27/19, 19:20 - Sara: I care about your feelings
12/27/19, 19:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then that's enough for me, as I already said a few times
12/27/19, 19:21 - Sara: I don’t want you to doubt about me and my actions
12/27/19, 19:21 - Sara: I know
12/27/19, 19:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: It will be better when we live closer
12/27/19, 19:22 - Sara: I want to prevent saying too much
12/27/19, 19:23 - Sara: As well
12/27/19, 19:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
12/27/19, 19:23 - Sara: Like i prefer avoiding problems by saying too much, saying like most of the stuff I do
12/27/19, 19:23 - Sara: I’m not trust-worthy I guess
12/27/19, 19:24 - Sara: I want again
12/27/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that you can tell me whatever you want, I suppose it's better than hiding things, Idk, most of this happens because of the distance, it seems
12/27/19, 19:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully I can solve that issue somehow, or at least improve it
12/27/19, 19:34 - Sara: Which issue?
12/27/19, 19:34 - Sara: I try to be closer
12/27/19, 19:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Distance issue
12/27/19, 19:53 - Sara: Do you think that causes the misunderstandings?
12/27/19, 19:55 - Sara: I love you,  that is
12/27/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, certainly doesn't make it easier
12/27/19, 21:19 - Sara: True
12/27/19, 21:19 - Sara: I hope I’m doing my best
12/27/19, 21:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was just looking at the sites with flights, I enjoy doing that sometimes and I don't fully udnerstand why flying to Brussels is so cheap, pretty much almost all the time
12/27/19, 21:23 - Sara: It is the common place go do scale
12/27/19, 21:23 - Sara: Centre i gyess
12/27/19, 21:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's easier to fly to Italy than to Spain, can you be Italian?
12/27/19, 21:38 - Sara: Sì
12/27/19, 21:38 - Sara: We can find a meeting place
12/27/19, 21:38 - Sara: Cheap for both of us haha
12/27/19, 21:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, Brussels xd
12/27/19, 21:39 - Sara: But expensive in general hahaha
12/27/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, not my fault that it is flying anywhere further than Spain or Portugal from Madrid is expensive xd
12/27/19, 22:01 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/27/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was just looking at prices of flights from Madrid to different parts of Europe and it's not really that cheap
12/27/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: From Warsaw seems like there are more cheap options
12/27/19, 22:02 - Sara: Which ones are the cheapests?
12/27/19, 22:02 - Sara: Cheapest*
12/27/19, 22:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: From Madrid or from Warsaw?
12/27/19, 22:03 - Sara: For you
12/27/19, 22:03 - Sara: Have checked as well from madrid? XD
12/27/19, 22:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was curious, I enjoy checking this stuff
12/27/19, 22:04 - Sara: Well
12/27/19, 22:04 - Sara: Tell me both
12/27/19, 22:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, admittedly, I was checking for January so in other months can be different
12/27/19, 22:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/27/19, 22:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hot wine 🍷 🔥
12/27/19, 22:13 - Sara: Please
12/27/19, 22:13 - Sara: BUT WITHOUT GINGER

12/27/19, 22:13 - Sara: Is it only there?
12/27/19, 22:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: And you missed out on the cats, obviously
12/27/19, 22:14 - Sara: I remember drinking it in a restaurant in november
12/27/19, 22:14 - Sara: Sad
12/27/19, 22:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know actually, I only saw it in the Christmas markets but I wasn't really looking so we can see
12/27/19, 22:15 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/27/19, 22:15 - Sara: ?
12/27/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Practicing the guitar, programming a bit, some Spanish
12/27/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I decided to take a look at some of the most common phrases and I'll try to get used to them
12/27/19, 22:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: You?
12/27/19, 22:17 - Sara: Cool!
12/27/19, 22:17 - Sara: I went with my mother to see a dance/choir spectacule
12/27/19, 22:17 - Sara: It was cool ^^
12/27/19, 22:17 - Sara: And now i’m having dinner at home
12/27/19, 22:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: What kind of dance?
12/27/19, 22:20 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/27/19, 22:21 - Sara: It was lyric but modern
12/27/19, 22:21 - Sara: Cool combination
12/27/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: So intenseee
12/27/19, 22:24 - Sara: Is it?
12/27/19, 22:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: That kind of music is always like, oh shit, apocalypse
12/27/19, 22:25 - Sara: You know the song right? XD
12/27/19, 22:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup
12/27/19, 22:25 - Sara: But fair enough
12/27/19, 22:25 - Sara: Others songs were slower
12/27/19, 22:25 - Sara: But in general it was good
12/27/19, 22:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems nice
12/27/19, 22:27 - Sara: Yep
12/27/19, 22:27 - Sara: Amd what are you doing?
12/27/19, 22:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now, I finally decided to continue my little WhatsApp analyzer project, recently I studied a new technology that can help me solve some problems that I had with it
12/27/19, 22:30 - Sara: Cool
12/27/19, 22:30 - Sara: You will tell me

12/27/19, 23:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which kind would you like? The aggressive forehead, the gentle cheek, the romantic lips, the passionate neck?
12/27/19, 23:18 - Sara: Uf
12/27/19, 23:18 - Sara: All of them
12/27/19, 23:18 - Sara: Please

12/27/19, 23:22 - Sara: Sorry for before, btw
12/27/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it actually arrived in 2 weeks so not so long xd
12/27/19, 23:22 - Sara: :P
12/27/19, 23:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, I'm fine
12/27/19, 23:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't worry 💋
12/27/19, 23:23 - Sara: Thanks
12/27/19, 23:23 - Sara: I was a little bit altered
12/27/19, 23:23 - Sara: Altered? Haha
12/27/19, 23:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: Brrr, it's getting a little bit cold here and it's even snowing, although rather symbolically, I would say xd
12/27/19, 23:36 - Sara: So? 🌝
12/27/19, 23:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just saying 😏
12/27/19, 23:36 - Sara: Will I see snow?
12/27/19, 23:36 - Sara: Do you need hugs?
12/27/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably, I hope at least, there should be a ton of snow already but unfortunately Poland is slowly becoming Spain
12/27/19, 23:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes, always
12/27/19, 23:37 - Sara: NOoOooOooOO
12/27/19, 23:37 - Sara: ⛄

12/27/19, 23:39 - Sara: Castellano-manchegan hug, little/big spoon hug and a 5-min hug
12/27/19, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cuánto cuesta?
12/27/19, 23:39 - Sara: A trip to Krakov
12/27/19, 23:39 - Sara: :p
12/27/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough, I'll take all you have
12/27/19, 23:40 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/27/19, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Everything you have in store xd
12/27/19, 23:41 - Sara: What a coincidence!
12/27/19, 23:42 - Sara: :P
12/27/19, 23:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: So long, why is Spain so damn far 😓
12/27/19, 23:44 - Sara: Poland ejem
12/27/19, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just read that apparently according to some scientist, this winter may be the coldest in 30 years xddd
12/27/19, 23:47 - Sara: We are going yo destroy it in 5 xd
12/27/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Somehow I doubt that, although they mention that it should come in January, so maybe xd
12/27/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Qué?
12/27/19, 23:47 - Sara: Ah
12/27/19, 23:47 - Sara: I misunderstood

12/27/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Start buying more jumpers
12/27/19, 23:52 - Sara: Ugly ones?
12/27/19, 23:52 - Sara: But I have to be the gothic, bro
12/27/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: They will be completely covered in snow so doesn't matter
12/27/19, 23:53 - Sara: Not make me regret this HAHAHHAA
12/27/19, 23:53 - Sara: WEll
12/27/19, 23:53 - Sara: More hugs 💕

12/27/19, 23:54 - Sara: Spanish 45° in the south
12/27/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: After I take of all the clothes I will have to figure out how to take of skin and muscles as well
12/27/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: but my skeleton would probably still sweat anyway
12/27/19, 23:56 - Sara: True

12/28/19, 00:34 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/28/19, 00:42 - Sara: ~Goes to the bathroom~
12/28/19, 00:43 - Sara: Would you act like that?
12/28/19, 00:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would be totally panicked but no, I wouldn't run away, come on
12/28/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mean, my Spanish is not good enough yet to live in Mexico
12/28/19, 00:44 - Sara: Panic hahahaa
12/28/19, 00:44 - Sara: But you seseas ;p
12/28/19, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I what?
12/28/19, 00:45 - Sara: Sesear
12/28/19, 00:45 - Sara: When you pronounce a c as an s
12/28/19, 00:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's a start, wait with becoming pregnant until I'm ready to run away
12/28/19, 00:46 - Sara: Hahahaha
12/28/19, 00:47 - Sara: You should start again exercising
12/28/19, 00:47 - Sara: Damn, Guada has told me to meet now
12/28/19, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like meet right now?
12/28/19, 00:47 - Sara: Yes
12/28/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: A little bit late, no?
12/28/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did he say why?
12/28/19, 00:48 - Sara: Yep, but not the first time
12/28/19, 00:48 - Sara: No
12/28/19, 00:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: But he told you before or just now?
12/28/19, 00:49 - Sara: Now
12/28/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, a bit weird
12/28/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you going?
12/28/19, 00:49 - Sara: Yes
12/28/19, 00:49 - Sara: Just going to my door
12/28/19, 00:49 - Sara: We are almost neighbours
12/28/19, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, ok
12/28/19, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I didn't know that, ok, that makes a bit more sense
12/28/19, 00:51 - Sara: Yes
12/28/19, 00:51 - Sara: Maybe this is insane
12/28/19, 00:51 - Sara: Right?
12/28/19, 00:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Seems so
12/28/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess it's fine to talk if you just need to go to your door
12/28/19, 00:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although with all the recent behavior...
12/28/19, 00:53 - Sara: Do you think is it not fair?
12/28/19, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can at least hear him out, I guess
12/28/19, 00:54 - Sara: As well
12/28/19, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yes, he made a decision, even though you didn't want to end your friendship
12/28/19, 00:55 - Sara: True
12/28/19, 00:55 - Sara: But I believe people are good  at the end
12/28/19, 00:56 - Sara: Maybe i’m stupid for that
12/28/19, 00:56 - Sara: I give opportunities all the time
12/28/19, 00:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, so as I said
12/28/19, 00:57 - Sara: I’ll do
12/28/19, 00:58 - Sara: 1 hour or something like that
12/28/19, 00:58 - Sara: Tomorrow I want to get up early
12/28/19, 01:00 - Sara: I’m crazy
12/28/19, 01:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, good luck, I guess?
12/28/19, 01:01 - Sara: Thanks
12/28/19, 01:01 - Sara: I hope to be better with this
12/28/19, 01:01 - Sara: I hope as well that this is not a problem for you
12/28/19, 01:04 - Sara: I love you
12/28/19, 01:04 - Sara: Thanks 💋
12/28/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope I live long enough to see the end of this story 😋
12/28/19, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Love you too ❤️
12/28/19, 01:06 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
12/28/19, 01:07 - Sara: Sad but true
12/28/19, 01:07 - Sara: Imagine me having a healthy mind 😝
12/28/19, 12:08 - Sara: Dzén dobry ☀ 💕
12/28/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dzień*
12/28/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buenos días 💋
12/28/19, 12:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
12/28/19, 12:43 - Sara: Ñ
12/28/19, 12:43 - Sara: A bit tired
12/28/19, 12:43 - Sara: But nice
12/28/19, 12:43 - Sara: Going to Madrid
12/28/19, 12:43 - Sara: You?
12/28/19, 12:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine as well
12/28/19, 12:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: How did it go with Guada?
12/28/19, 12:44 - Sara: I think it was good to make things clear
12/28/19, 12:44 - Sara: Well, the base is the same
12/28/19, 12:45 - Sara: But at least we know each other’s perspective
12/28/19, 12:45 - Sara: Also I have learnt that i’m getting over the relationship little by little
12/28/19, 12:45 - Sara: Or it is not that painful anymore
12/28/19, 12:45 - Sara: We were talking until 4, so we had so many things to talk
12/28/19, 12:46 - Sara: He told me not to meet the two of us alone, but the rest is fine
12/28/19, 12:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw did you meet with your other friends?
12/28/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: The ones that you had some doubts about?
12/28/19, 12:48 - Sara: I’m going now with them
12/28/19, 12:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you going to talk about what bothers you?
12/28/19, 12:49 - Sara: If I see it appropriate, yes
12/28/19, 12:49 - Sara: Not about what bothers me, I think it is about my insecurities
12/28/19, 12:49 - Sara: What about you? ^^
12/28/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't really have any specific plans, it's almost January so I'm thinking about sending some CVs soon to companies but I before that I should probably end my WhatsApp project and maybe make another one or two as well
12/28/19, 12:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I might focus on that
12/28/19, 12:51 - Sara: Cool! How is the project going?
12/28/19, 12:52 - Sara: (Btw, thanks for your immense support ❤)
12/28/19, 12:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really hope that it all goes well, both with  Guada and the rest
12/28/19, 12:53 - Sara: Thanks 🥺♥
12/28/19, 12:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I have an idea how to solve the problem I had with it before and I'm also trying to use a different technology now so I need to change it a bit
12/28/19, 12:58 - Sara: Which problem?
12/28/19, 12:59 - Sara: That is nice
12/28/19, 12:59 - Sara: How long is it going to take?
12/28/19, 12:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Honestly, don't know, depends on how many features I decide to add
12/28/19, 13:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hopefully not very long, I know how to do it now
12/28/19, 13:00 - Sara: Are you in a hurry for the CVsv
12/28/19, 13:00 - Sara: ?
12/28/19, 13:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, a bit, I guess, would be useful to add some previous work to it, that seems to be fairly effective
12/28/19, 13:01 - Sara: Yes 💕
12/28/19, 13:01 - Sara: That is nice
12/28/19, 13:02 - Sara: And what about the internship? Something new?
12/28/19, 13:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've been looking and I have something maybe but honestly the offers on the Erasmus website are not that interesting
12/28/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll take a look on some other websites
12/28/19, 13:03 - Sara: But can you do them internationally if you are not erasmus?
12/28/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the Erasmus office they told me that it can be any internship, if I just ask the company, they can apply for the program, I think
12/28/19, 13:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's how I understood it
12/28/19, 13:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: Besides, I can just try to go normally, without erasmus
12/28/19, 13:04 - Sara: Well, it’s cool in that case
12/28/19, 13:04 - Sara: Maybe it is more difficult, but as well
12/28/19, 13:04 - Sara: Well, idk how this works
12/28/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know, I mean, in both cases I'm sending CVs and they have to accept me so hard to tell if it's harder
12/28/19, 13:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe with Erasmus they are more open to foreigners
12/28/19, 13:05 - Sara: True
12/28/19, 13:05 - Sara: And they give you money right?
12/28/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Depends on an internship, I'm looking only at ones that do
12/28/19, 13:06 - Sara: I mean
12/28/19, 13:06 - Sara: Apart from the salary
12/28/19, 13:06 - Sara: Or that is the only money you can receive?
12/28/19, 13:06 - Sara: I thought it worked like erasmus studies
12/28/19, 13:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, yes, although I have only 2 Erasmus months left
12/28/19, 13:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: So they told me in the office that they can make a short contract and the rest of the internship I would have just regularly, without erasmus
12/28/19, 13:07 - Sara: That is nice
12/28/19, 13:07 - Sara: And have you found something?
12/28/19, 13:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe, I saved a few offers, I don't remember where exactly, I'll tell you later
12/28/19, 13:08 - Sara: Nice
12/28/19, 13:08 - Sara: I have just arrived to Madrid ^^
12/28/19, 13:08 - Sara: But i can still talk in the subway
12/28/19, 13:09 - Sara: What is your plan?
12/28/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll get going with the project, most likely
12/28/19, 13:10 - Sara: Good luck!
12/28/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Gracias, tú también
12/28/19, 13:13 - Sara: 🤗
12/28/19, 13:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmmm, I didn't know that Spain has two cities in Africa
12/28/19, 13:49 - Sara: Empire remains xD
12/28/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: How would you translate el remate to English?
12/28/19, 17:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like in a football sense?
12/28/19, 17:46 - Sara: Mmmm
12/28/19, 17:46 - Sara: No idea
12/28/19, 17:46 - Sara: Shoot maybe
12/28/19, 17:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ok, I thought that it's like the shot or something
12/28/19, 17:46 - Sara: Shot
12/28/19, 17:46 - Sara: Yes
12/28/19, 20:01 - Sara: How is it going?
12/28/19, 20:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok, nothing unusual, you?
12/28/19, 20:03 - Sara: Nice
12/28/19, 20:03 - Sara: It has been really nice
12/28/19, 20:04 - Sara: But i wanted to talk with two of them about the situation but there are no sits in the bus for the 3 of us together :(
12/28/19, 20:04 - Sara: But I have confidence
12/28/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Vuelves a Toledo ahora mismo?
12/28/19, 20:05 - Sara: Si ^^
12/28/19, 20:05 - Sara: And then I’ll meet Christian and some friends
12/28/19, 20:05 - Sara: The one we watched Star Wars
12/28/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Guay 😎
12/28/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Entonces, todo bien?
12/28/19, 20:06 - Sara: Hahahahaha
12/28/19, 20:07 - Sara: Creo que sí
12/28/19, 20:07 - Sara: Espero ser mas honesta con la gente
12/28/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ojalá todo sea bien
12/28/19, 20:08 - Sara: Subjuntivo...
12/28/19, 20:09 - Sara: :P
12/28/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: En realidad, estoy seguro que todo irá bien
12/28/19, 20:09 - Sara: Better ^^
12/28/19, 20:09 - Sara: Ojalá todo vaya bien
12/28/19, 20:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Siempre necesito usar 'ir' en vez de 'ser'?
12/28/19, 20:11 - Sara: En “irá bien”? Sí
12/28/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Claro, gracias
12/28/19, 20:12 - Sara: Nada, amor
12/28/19, 20:12 - Sara: 💋
12/28/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I learned some stuff about it already so I'm trying to use it a bit xd
12/28/19, 20:14 - Sara: Perfect
12/28/19, 20:14 - Sara: You can apply it ^^
12/28/19, 20:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/28/19, 20:35 - Sara: I wish I could see it like that
12/28/19, 20:35 - Sara: But I don’t want to have any problem with snow :(
12/28/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, we're not going anywhere by car so should be fine, I think
12/28/19, 20:36 - Sara: And bus?
12/28/19, 20:36 - Sara: But Poland should be used to this xD
12/28/19, 20:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't expect any big problems, especially not in big cities
12/28/19, 20:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Eventually we'll arrive xdddd
12/28/19, 20:37 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/28/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if it snows terribly and it will be the worst weather in 30 years then the travel might be slowed down a bit xd
12/28/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at some point we'll arrive at the destination, I hope xd
12/28/19, 20:39 - Sara: I hope as well
12/28/19, 20:39 - Sara: And not being trapped in Poland :s
12/28/19, 20:39 - Sara: Ugh
12/28/19, 20:39 - Sara: Such a horrible country
12/28/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: You might need to take learning polish seriously xd
12/28/19, 20:40 - Sara: Be my teacher ^^
12/28/19, 21:52 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/28/19, 21:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/28/19, 21:54 - Sara: Hahahha yep

12/28/19, 21:55 - Sara: Are you okay?
12/28/19, 21:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sure
12/28/19, 21:57 - Sara: Good :)
12/28/19, 22:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa-4IAR_9Yw
12/28/19, 22:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: This resonates with me on all possible levels
12/28/19, 22:54 - Sara: What do you mean?
12/28/19, 22:54 - Sara: I’m out, i’ll watch it later ^^
12/28/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: You'll understand when you watch xd
12/28/19, 22:54 - Sara: Am i into you?
12/28/19, 22:54 - Sara: XD
12/28/19, 22:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is Sara into me? Mmm, can't really tell
12/28/19, 22:54 - Sara: Why? XD
12/28/19, 22:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
12/28/19, 22:55 - Sara: Well, we can discuss it later haha
12/29/19, 02:31 - Sara: JAJAJA
12/29/19, 02:31 - Sara: MAN
12/29/19, 02:31 - Sara: YOU DID NOT REALISED AT ALL XD
12/29/19, 08:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mmm, they are good signs but can't really tell, maybe it's a misunderstanding and you just wanted to be a friend that is a girl and not a girlfriend and something was lost in translation? Better to be careful and just keep looking for signs.
12/29/19, 10:08 - Sara: Yes
12/29/19, 10:08 - Sara: Definitely :p
12/29/19, 10:08 - Sara: Jak się masz?

12/29/19, 10:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Todo bien? Algo serio?
12/29/19, 10:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: You will have your period around the time of the trip, right?
12/29/19, 10:15 - Sara: No, diarrea xd
12/29/19, 10:15 - Sara: También tomé bebida con gas, y no suelo beberla
12/29/19, 10:15 - Sara: Solo los 2-3 primeros dias
12/29/19, 10:16 - Sara: En mi examen de estudios de género xd

12/29/19, 10:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 10:23 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 12:35 - Sara: Ay, Blanca has asked me about long-distante relationships
12/29/19, 12:35 - Sara: Poor baby 🥺

12/29/19, 13:10 - Sara: USA
12/29/19, 13:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: How did that happen?
12/29/19, 13:10 - Sara: I didn't ask her in depth
12/29/19, 13:11 - Sara: But I know he was here in Spain for 2 weeks or something like that
12/29/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: In any case, her distance beats ours xd
12/29/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just 2 weeks and the are in a relationship?
12/29/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: That's quite fast
12/29/19, 13:12 - Sara: Wait
12/29/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: 10 hour flights 😱
12/29/19, 13:12 - Sara: Sure xd
12/29/19, 13:12 - Sara: Si, estuvimos casi dos meses juntos y ahora esta semana hace un mes que estamos a distancia
12/29/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: So 2 months, not weeks
12/29/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, than it's more reasonable
12/29/19, 13:13 - Sara: hahah my mistake
12/29/19, 13:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Btw, where is she from exactly?
12/29/19, 13:14 - Sara: Sevilla

12/29/19, 13:16 - Sara: el proyecto de informática?
12/29/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Exactamente
12/29/19, 13:16 - Sara: ''Estudiando''
12/29/19, 13:17 - Sara: Mucho ánumo
12/29/19, 13:17 - Sara: *ánimo
12/29/19, 13:17 - Sara: Y hablando con Blanca
12/29/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Como siempre xd
12/29/19, 13:17 - Sara: OYEEEEE
12/29/19, 13:17 - Sara: Estoy con parte práctica
12/29/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Parte práctica de qué?
12/29/19, 13:19 - Sara: De semántica
12/29/19, 13:19 - Sara: Actividades
12/29/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Por el examen?
12/29/19, 13:20 - Sara: Para el examen?*
12/29/19, 13:20 - Sara: Sí ^^
12/29/19, 13:20 - Sara: Es el primero que tengo
12/29/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: No esfuérzate demasiado 💋
12/29/19, 13:23 - Sara: A qué te refieres?
12/29/19, 13:23 - Sara: :p
12/29/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: .
12/29/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xd
12/29/19, 13:24 - Sara: Que no me esfuerzo demasiado?
12/29/19, 13:24 - Sara: La frase no tiene sentido en español :c
12/29/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: #llorando
12/29/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Spanglish xd
12/29/19, 13:25 - Sara: Un poco
12/29/19, 13:25 - Sara: :P
12/29/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: Más o menos, espero que me entiendas xd
12/29/19, 13:26 - Sara: No aquí
12/29/19, 13:26 - Sara: Sí en general
12/29/19, 14:16 - Sara: Btw, i’d like to ask a question
12/29/19, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ask then
12/29/19, 14:18 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 14:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 14:21 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 14:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I would probably start by talking with you, I don't think I would do anything without telling you. First priority would be to make sure that you're fine. I never really thought about it as a sort of possession thing, when someone hurts my friends, I obviously don't like it, I don't think it would be very different for me if it would happen to a friend or a girlfriend, family, pretty much anybody I care about
12/29/19, 14:38 - Sara: :)
12/29/19, 14:38 - Sara: Talking with me?
12/29/19, 14:38 - Sara: Not for consent right?
12/29/19, 14:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: What happened, are you okay, how can I help, ~can I murder whoever did this~~
12/29/19, 14:39 - Sara: Fair enough
12/29/19, 14:39 - Sara: I know that defend people is okay, but guys’ attitude...
12/29/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, probably depends on a specific person, not everyone is quick to violence
12/29/19, 14:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me it depends on what specifically would happen
12/29/19, 14:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: Catcalling is not the same as rape
12/29/19, 14:41 - Sara: But I have heard similar responses among guys
12/29/19, 14:41 - Sara: Yes and no
12/29/19, 14:41 - Sara: But idk, like men are more violent
12/29/19, 14:41 - Sara: Women not too much
12/29/19, 14:42 - Sara: Normally
12/29/19, 14:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: In general, yes
12/29/19, 14:42 - Sara: So idk
12/29/19, 14:43 - Sara: I wouldn’t like to feel defenceless
12/29/19, 14:43 - Sara: U know?
12/29/19, 14:43 - Sara: But of course I’d like to feel I have support
12/29/19, 14:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: But you're referring to someone defending you or something else?
12/29/19, 14:43 - Sara: In general
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: Men defending women in general
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: Well
12/29/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would it be different if you had a girlfriend defending you?
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: Girlfriend protected by boyfriend
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: In this case
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: In what sense?
12/29/19, 14:44 - Sara: I’d expect to defend me
12/29/19, 14:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Would you feel differently about this?
12/29/19, 14:45 - Sara: Nop
12/29/19, 14:45 - Sara: But because men have always felt physically superior and more territorial
12/29/19, 14:45 - Sara: I think
12/29/19, 14:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it made sense during the time of tribes and stuff like that
12/29/19, 14:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: And to some extent that is still present I suppose
12/29/19, 14:46 - Sara: It shouldn’t
12/29/19, 14:46 - Sara: I’m not a posession 😂
12/29/19, 14:47 - Sara: Any girl is
12/29/19, 14:48 - Sara: I don’t need others to protect me if that supposes an intensified gender role
12/29/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 14:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ah, you didn't watch lord of the rings, right?
12/29/19, 14:48 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 14:48 - Sara: I want to read ir
12/29/19, 14:49 - Sara: It*
12/29/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Such a wasted reference potential, muy mal
12/29/19, 14:49 - Sara: Like if someone protects me i hope it is because they care about me, not for feeling superior
12/29/19, 14:49 - Sara: Kamil
12/29/19, 14:49 - Sara: I know the reference
12/29/19, 14:49 - Sara: I’m not that silly xd
12/29/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🙄
12/29/19, 14:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Xddd
12/29/19, 14:50 - Sara: Not that silly I said xd
12/29/19, 14:51 - Sara: I like thinkng and discussing thesr topics, sorry haha
12/29/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't know, typically the stronger protect the weaker, not because they feel better but because they care and the weaker may not be able to protect themselves
12/29/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least that's my perspective
12/29/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe some people see it differently
12/29/19, 14:52 - Sara: Who said women are weaker? 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
12/29/19, 14:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Did I say women here?
12/29/19, 14:53 - Sara: Well, it is mentioned in the context
12/29/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would say in general, like also parents typically protect their children, for example
12/29/19, 14:54 - Sara: Well, that is obvious
12/29/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: And in this case I wouldn't generalize but look at specific situations
12/29/19, 14:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: There are people that are stronger than you and there are people that are weaker than you
12/29/19, 14:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, weaker or stronger can be interpreted in many ways but in this case, let's say physically
12/29/19, 14:56 - Sara: I guess
12/29/19, 14:56 - Sara: Specific situation and people
12/29/19, 14:56 - Sara: I can defend myself from catcalling perfectly or if a guy touches me, but idk if from rape
12/29/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: So as I said, specific situations
12/29/19, 14:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: And attitudes of people, I guess
12/29/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: So I probably wouldn't bother to go after someone who catcalled you but after a rapist probably yes
12/29/19, 14:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't know exactly in what way, but I don't think I would just leave it
12/29/19, 14:59 - Sara: Yes
12/29/19, 14:59 - Sara: Me neither
12/29/19, 14:59 - Sara: But i’d be panicking c:
12/29/19, 15:07 - Sara: Btw
12/29/19, 15:07 - Sara: Do you want to call today?
12/29/19, 15:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you just fly here instead?
12/29/19, 15:10 - Sara: 4 more sundays :)
12/29/19, 16:57 - Sara: Your penis now makes an audible sound when ejaculating, any sound of your choosing...what's your choice?
12/29/19, 16:57 - Sara: Xd
12/29/19, 17:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: https://youtu.be/w0xbP83McGk
12/29/19, 17:08 - Sara: Pffff
12/29/19, 17:08 - Sara: Why clapping?

12/29/19, 17:09 - Sara: Well

12/29/19, 18:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/29/19, 18:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nah, subjuntivo is not so bad, the insane amount of words per minute that Spanish speakers spit out is a problem xddd
12/29/19, 18:28 - Sara: But as everyone else in their native language xD
12/29/19, 18:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think Spanish is faster but yeah, pretty much
12/29/19, 18:29 - Sara: We are ~better~ different :)
12/29/19, 18:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: 'Different' 🤪
12/29/19, 18:33 - Sara: Is it not true?

12/29/19, 20:38 - Sara: :)
12/29/19, 20:38 - Sara: You tell me if you want
12/29/19, 20:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how are you?
12/29/19, 20:39 - Sara: Well... My stomach has been achina the whole day
12/29/19, 20:39 - Sara: I wanted to go to the rehearsal room and I felt tired
12/29/19, 20:39 - Sara: So I watched some videos on YT and I went to sleep
12/29/19, 20:39 - Sara: I feel a little bit bored, so I'll study a bit
12/29/19, 20:39 - Sara: You?
12/29/19, 20:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Are you better now?
12/29/19, 20:40 - Sara: More or less the same
12/29/19, 20:40 - Sara: I'll eat rice, maybe tomorrow I can be better ahaha
12/29/19, 20:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is it because of the period?
12/29/19, 20:40 - Sara: At this moment, I don't know
12/29/19, 20:41 - Sara: Well, normally during your period you tend to have a little bit of diarrhea
12/29/19, 20:41 - Sara: But I have never had this before
12/29/19, 20:41 - Sara: Yesterday maybe I drank a little bit of Monster and some Pringles and maybe it wasn't good for my body
12/29/19, 20:41 - Sara: Maybe cold... idk
12/29/19, 20:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: I hope it's nothing serious, rest as much as you can
12/29/19, 20:42 - Sara: Also I feel sad because I'd like to go to the rehearsal room more often but I'm a lit afraid of driving alone again
12/29/19, 20:42 - Sara: I hope that as well
12/29/19, 20:42 - Sara: Thanks ❤
12/29/19, 20:42 - Sara: Are you okay?
12/29/19, 20:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, last days I've finally managed to be more productive and I hope to continue that going forward
12/29/19, 20:43 - Sara: Glad to hear that :D
12/29/19, 20:43 - Sara: What did you do?
12/29/19, 20:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, some Spanish but mostly programming, I also started reading a book about algorithms
12/29/19, 20:45 - Sara: Oh,the book helps you?
12/29/19, 20:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it covers some concepts that can potentially be useful and it's not particularly long
12/29/19, 20:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: I also want to read more books, lately I read plenty, but mostly websites, articles and that sort of thing
12/29/19, 20:49 - Sara: But for helping you or to enterntain?
12/29/19, 21:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Both, at the moment for work, because soon I'll be searching for it so that's the focus but after that's done also for entertainment
12/29/19, 21:59 - Sara: Nice
12/29/19, 21:59 - Sara: Btw im free
12/29/19, 22:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm almost too
12/29/19, 22:02 - Sara: U tell me then
12/29/19, 22:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now is fine
12/29/19, 22:03 - Sara: Okay i call you asap
12/29/19, 22:12 - Sara: My grandma asking about you and your family
12/29/19, 22:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: What specifically? 😋
12/29/19, 22:15 - Sara: I tell you know
12/29/19, 22:15 - Sara: :P
12/29/19, 22:20 - Sara: Wifi goes horrible ufh
12/29/19, 22:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: On my end a bit too, but I guess we can try at least
12/30/19, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

12/30/19, 01:33 - Sara: :,)
12/30/19, 01:41 - Sara: Sorry
12/30/19, 01:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: ?
12/30/19, 01:41 - Sara: Like, the Italy moment came and the break up when we mentioned the sexual situation and idk, i want to be everything fine between us
12/30/19, 01:43 - Kamil Kuźniak: Lo pasado, pasado está
12/30/19, 01:43 - Sara: And i don’t want you to stop loving me if there is sonething that it is still wrong
12/30/19, 01:44 - Sara: And maybe I need to be said “hey, i love you”
12/30/19, 01:44 - Sara: Espero
12/30/19, 01:44 - Sara: I’m such a dramatic
12/30/19, 01:44 - Sara: Xd
12/30/19, 01:44 - Sara: Good night 🤗
12/30/19, 01:45 - Sara: I stop 😂
12/30/19, 01:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Kocham cię kotku i słodkich snów 💋
12/30/19, 01:45 - Sara: 🤗

12/30/19, 12:58 - Sara: https://loudwire.com/best-rock-songs-decade-2010-2019/
12/30/19, 13:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cómo estás, amor? Mejor?
12/30/19, 13:10 - Sara: Mucho mejor
12/30/19, 13:10 - Sara: No he ido al baño todavía, pero no me duele la tripa
12/30/19, 13:10 - Sara: Tu estás bien?
12/30/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sí, bien también
12/30/19, 13:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Genial 😊
12/30/19, 13:12 - Sara: Comí mucho arroz ayer 😂
12/30/19, 13:12 - Sara: Qué haces?
12/30/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ahora mismo, nada
12/30/19, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Empiezo a trabajar en mi proyecto pronto
12/30/19, 13:13 - Sara: Empezaré ^^
12/30/19, 13:13 - Sara: Genial
12/30/19, 13:13 - Sara: You should do a project about how much music made for women are in spotify xd
12/30/19, 13:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: How do you classify music as 'made for women'?
12/30/19, 13:14 - Sara: Well
12/30/19, 13:14 - Sara: By instead of for hahaha
12/30/19, 13:15 - Sara: With women playing
12/30/19, 13:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe, it depends if I can get access to the data, with WhatsApp it's easy because you can easily get the whole conversation in one file
12/30/19, 13:15 - Sara: True, by email right?
12/30/19, 13:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, in the app you just pick 'export chat' option and it's saved on the device
12/30/19, 13:17 - Sara: Oh, better
12/30/19, 13:17 - Sara: Well, idk for spotify
12/30/19, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, data about all the music that's there might be hard to come by
12/30/19, 13:18 - Sara: Well, there are other music platforms as well
12/30/19, 13:18 - Sara: But probably it is hard haha
12/30/19, 13:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Analyzing the data is not particularly difficult but getting the data can be an issue
12/30/19, 13:18 - Sara: Do you have other projects appart from the whatapp one?
12/30/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, right now I'm doing that project and continuing a course on data science and machine learning
12/30/19, 13:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's quite enough at the moment
12/30/19, 13:19 - Sara: In the website you reccomended me?
12/30/19, 13:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: In udemy, I think I mentioned it
12/30/19, 13:20 - Sara: Yep
12/30/19, 13:20 - Sara: I should do some courses
12/30/19, 13:20 - Sara: Maybe in summer
12/30/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: You should check it from time to time because they make sales on the courses
12/30/19, 13:21 - Sara: Oh
12/30/19, 13:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: I often just buy something that interests me to study it later
12/30/19, 13:21 - Sara: Are they not free?
12/30/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Some are free and some are paid
12/30/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: On sale it's typically around 10 euro for a course
12/30/19, 13:22 - Sara: Not bad
12/30/19, 13:22 - Sara: With certificate I guess
12/30/19, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: The free website was edx, I think
12/30/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that one was different
12/30/19, 13:23 - Sara: Yep
12/30/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: With courses made by universities
12/30/19, 13:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: On udemy they are made by some private educators
12/30/19, 13:23 - Sara: 👍
12/30/19, 13:23 - Sara: I’ll try to check it
12/30/19, 13:23 - Sara: Don’t hate me xD
12/30/19, 13:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: Up to you, I'm just telling you about it because you seemed interested ~can't really tell~, do whatever you want with that
12/30/19, 13:25 - Sara: No, yes
12/30/19, 13:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: No pressure
12/30/19, 13:25 - Sara: I am
12/30/19, 13:25 - Sara: But no time c:
12/30/19, 13:25 - Sara: I remember you got kind of angry with that dd
12/30/19, 13:25 - Sara: Xd
12/30/19, 13:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/30/19, 13:27 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 13:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Is that a promise?
12/30/19, 13:28 - Sara: Probably
12/30/19, 13:29 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 13:29 - Sara: Okay, now I feel like eating chocolate 🍫
12/30/19, 13:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😛🍑?
12/30/19, 13:31 - Sara: <Media omitted>

12/30/19, 13:31 - Sara: Real chocolate 🌝
12/30/19, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😥
12/30/19, 13:33 - Sara: Well, if you want...
12/30/19, 13:33 - Sara: I won’t complain
12/30/19, 13:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: 😷🕯️🍑
12/30/19, 13:34 - Sara: Candle? XD
12/30/19, 13:34 - Sara: 👓
12/30/19, 13:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: A light source, necessary for speleologico
12/30/19, 13:35 - Sara: Your glasses have that option
12/30/19, 13:35 - Sara: As far I have seen 🤔
12/30/19, 13:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: My father has a lamp that can be worn on forehead, I'll borrow it for the trip
12/30/19, 13:37 - Sara: How is the lamp? O,o
12/30/19, 13:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 13:38 - Sara: Pffff
12/30/19, 13:38 - Sara: Please
12/30/19, 13:38 - Sara: Bring it xD
12/30/19, 16:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: I just checked and for Auschwitz there are 3 options, tour for individuals without an educator for free, and two tours with an educator 3,5h for 55pln and 6h for 80pln
12/30/19, 16:01 - Sara: What do you think?
12/30/19, 16:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Idk, not sure if I want to walk around with a guide, but at the same time that way we can learn more
12/30/19, 16:07 - Sara: How many euros?
12/30/19, 16:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: 55pln is 13 euro and 80pln is 19 euro
12/30/19, 16:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will try to find more information on what specifically are these tours
12/30/19, 16:10 - Sara: Okaay
12/30/19, 16:10 - Sara: It could be interesting
12/30/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not entirely sure but it seems that the salt mine is free for students
12/30/19, 16:12 - Sara: Oh! That is great
12/30/19, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or not, the website is a bit weird
12/30/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Weird, first it said 0 but then it shows that it's around 20 euro per persob
12/30/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: *person
12/30/19, 16:15 - Sara: Wtf
12/30/19, 16:15 - Sara: Should we buy them there?
12/30/19, 16:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: If we decide to go there, probably
12/30/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: It is an official website of the salt mine, it's just pooely made, not unusual xd
12/30/19, 16:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: *poorly
12/30/19, 16:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's cheaper in polish xd

12/30/19, 16:33 - Sara: Okaaay

12/30/19, 16:33 - Sara: Thanks!
12/30/19, 16:33 - Sara: Do you need me to search for something?
12/30/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you have something you would like to visit, tell me, but you don't need to search
12/30/19, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: Only if you feel like
12/30/19, 16:34 - Sara: Okay
12/30/19, 16:34 - Sara: Thanks for your work 💕
12/30/19, 17:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, you searched for stuff in Spain so it makes sense that I'm looking for stuff in Poland 🇵🇱
12/30/19, 17:32 - Sara: Cute 💋
12/30/19, 17:32 - Sara: If I have some time today I can help ;)

12/30/19, 17:34 - Sara: Doing some reading for the bachellor projec
12/30/19, 17:34 - Sara: You?
12/30/19, 17:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm doing the course on udemy, I've just learned a nice new thing that I will probably try tu use in the project
12/30/19, 17:36 - Sara: Genial 💋
12/30/19, 17:36 - Sara: Trabaja duro 💪
12/30/19, 17:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: Data visualization so that I have nice graphs of the data I get
12/30/19, 17:36 - Sara: Proud of you boy 😎
12/30/19, 17:37 - Sara: ❤
12/30/19, 17:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: And how is it going?
12/30/19, 17:37 - Sara: Nice, getting general information to write the literary review
12/30/19, 17:37 - Sara: I have really interesting papers
12/30/19, 17:37 - Sara: ^^
12/30/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Muy bien 💋
12/30/19, 17:38 - Sara: Gracias ^^
12/30/19, 17:38 - Sara: También estoy con las fotos del 2019

12/30/19, 17:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Claro que sí 😊
12/30/19, 17:39 - Sara: I love that you have been from the beginning of it
12/30/19, 17:39 - Sara: 💗
12/30/19, 17:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, almost
12/30/19, 17:39 - Sara: Some months

12/30/19, 17:39 - Sara: 😴
12/30/19, 17:45 - Sara: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 17:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, eventually it will grow again 😘
12/30/19, 17:46 - Sara: As well
12/30/19, 17:46 - Sara: I look really nice there :,(
12/30/19, 17:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: *you look really nice
12/30/19, 17:47 - Sara: Aw
12/30/19, 17:47 - Sara: Cutie boy 👦🏼 ❤
12/30/19, 17:47 - Sara: Thanks
12/30/19, 17:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: ~And then you will cut them and be sad about it later xd, your hair situation is a mystery to me~
12/30/19, 17:54 - Sara: Hahahahhaa the same
12/30/19, 17:54 - Sara: I want it short and long at the same tome
12/30/19, 17:54 - Sara: You prefer it long right?
12/30/19, 17:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: I liked it before, I liked it after you cut it, I like it after you changed the color, I suppose I just like you
12/30/19, 17:57 - Sara: Aw 💕
12/30/19, 17:57 - Sara: But be brave and be honest ;p
12/30/19, 17:57 - Sara: As ypu told me with the beard
12/30/19, 17:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: That is honest
12/30/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: But yes, I suppose I liked the longer the most
12/30/19, 17:58 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm a bit torn between which color I liked more
12/30/19, 17:59 - Sara: Love youuu 😊
12/30/19, 17:59 - Sara: Natural, a lit blond or red?
12/30/19, 17:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, all of them were nice and I don't really have a clear winner
12/30/19, 18:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: At the beginning red was looking a bit odd but now I like it a lot, I suppose I just got used to it
12/30/19, 18:35 - Sara: Hahaha
12/30/19, 18:35 - Sara: You love me :B
12/30/19, 19:32 - Sara: Ugh why am afraid of driving again 😑
12/30/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, because you don't have that much experience with it and you don't do it very often, nothing to be ashamed of
12/30/19, 19:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: Driving is pretty stressful in general
12/30/19, 19:45 - Sara: A lot of time
12/30/19, 19:46 - Sara: I used to go by car to the reharsal room
12/30/19, 19:46 - Sara: But I feel shity for that
12/30/19, 19:46 - Sara: I’m stupid xd
12/30/19, 19:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ecologic reasons or something else?
12/30/19, 19:47 - Sara: Well, that is obvious
12/30/19, 19:47 - Sara: But feel shitty for being insecure for driving
12/30/19, 19:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, as I said
12/30/19, 19:47 - Sara: But I love it :(
12/30/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: And from what you told me you didn't have much practice
12/30/19, 19:48 - Sara: Not too much, only some routes
12/30/19, 19:48 - Sara: Idk what to do
12/30/19, 19:48 - Kamil Kuźniak: So nothing surprising that you feel anxious about it
12/30/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, to feel better driving, the only way is by driving more
12/30/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: At least that's what worked for me
12/30/19, 19:49 - Sara: But with people?
12/30/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: I mostly was driving alone
12/30/19, 19:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's because I was driving to uni
12/30/19, 19:50 - Sara: You had to, right?
12/30/19, 19:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yes, but in the long term it's probably better to drive alone for gaining confidence
12/30/19, 19:50 - Sara: As well
12/30/19, 19:51 - Sara: Maybe at night it is less insecure
12/30/19, 19:51 - Sara: More*
12/30/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, for me, probably the most important part was driving in the city, that is the most stressful thing, driving outside of the city is rather easy
12/30/19, 19:52 - Sara: Yep
12/30/19, 19:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I personally prefer driving during the day, better visibility and overall just feels a bit safer
12/30/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: But at night is also not really a problem
12/30/19, 19:53 - Sara: Maybe it is about willingness?
12/30/19, 19:53 - Sara: Sometimes my insecurities are bigger than me 😔
12/30/19, 19:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I always had to drive first through the city and then outside, where there are no lights so at night it's not very pleasant
12/30/19, 19:54 - Sara: Maybe I can play drums now and I will feel less shitty
12/30/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: You can do it, I believe in you ❤️
12/30/19, 19:54 - Sara: Uf
12/30/19, 19:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: As well 💋
12/30/19, 19:54 - Sara: Aw thanks
12/30/19, 19:54 - Sara: But idk what to do for that
12/30/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, specifically for driving, just try to drive more, I guess
12/30/19, 19:55 - Sara: Probably i’d drive tomorrow to the rehearsal room
12/30/19, 19:55 - Sara: If I dare :)
12/30/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: First to some places that you already know pretty well
12/30/19, 19:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: And then to some less known
12/30/19, 19:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I dare you to do it 😘
12/30/19, 19:57 - Sara: Thanks
12/30/19, 19:57 - Sara: Maybe I should be more positive
12/30/19, 19:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Definitely, I think all this polish learning is affecting your mood xd 🇵🇱
12/30/19, 19:59 - Sara: I was like that
12/30/19, 19:59 - Sara: But it got worse for that xD
12/30/19, 20:00 - Sara: Why am I like this o,o
12/30/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: So you were always secretly polish
12/30/19, 20:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: That explains a lot
12/30/19, 20:00 - Sara: :)
12/30/19, 20:00 - Sara: Thanks Kamil 😑
12/30/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: De nada xd
12/30/19, 20:01 - Sara: Nie ma za co
12/30/19, 20:01 - Sara: :3
12/30/19, 20:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: ❤️
12/30/19, 20:01 - Sara: Nie wiem :3
12/30/19, 20:02 - Sara: I think i’ll play some drums, in case i don’t talk too much
12/30/19, 20:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Jak się masz?
12/30/19, 20:03 - Sara: I’m a little bit sad for the car stuff, and in general i’m tired of being so insecure ><
12/30/19, 20:03 - Sara: But i’m good
12/30/19, 20:03 - Sara: You? ^^
12/30/19, 20:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: But something happened?
12/30/19, 20:05 - Sara: Just thinking about that
12/30/19, 20:05 - Sara: And I wanted to go to the rehearsal rooms
12/30/19, 20:05 - Sara: But i’m afraid
12/30/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm fine, having dinner and then continuing the project
12/30/19, 20:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think you should go
12/30/19, 20:05 - Sara: Now it is a bit late I think
12/30/19, 20:05 - Sara: I can play drums here as well
12/30/19, 20:06 - Sara: But fuck
12/30/19, 20:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, maybe tomorrow then?
12/30/19, 20:06 - Sara: That is what i said
12/30/19, 20:06 - Sara: Maybe i can drive a bit in the morning
12/30/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: 🍆🍑? Xdd
12/30/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry, I had to
12/30/19, 20:07 - Sara: Xd
12/30/19, 20:07 - Sara: No problem
12/30/19, 20:07 - Sara: I hate being like this I guess
12/30/19, 20:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: This sounds like a good idea
12/30/19, 20:08 - Sara: Yes
12/30/19, 20:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
12/30/19, 20:08 - Sara: I hope I can do it
12/30/19, 20:08 - Sara: Like i don’t want to feel like the day i took you to the mountain
12/30/19, 20:08 - Sara: :,)
12/30/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sadly, might be inevitable, but if you practice more I assure you that that feeling goes away
12/30/19, 20:09 - Sara: Hill hahaha
12/30/19, 20:09 - Sara: I guess
12/30/19, 20:09 - Sara: Ugh
12/30/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was feeling similar when I first started driving
12/30/19, 20:09 - Kamil Kuźniak: And now it just bores me to death xd
12/30/19, 20:10 - Sara: Really?
12/30/19, 20:10 - Sara: Really?:o
12/30/19, 20:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Yup, around the second or third year I actually still wanted to drive
12/30/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: But now I just let my brother do it because it's sooooo booooring
12/30/19, 20:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I remember the first time I had to go to uni, barely few days after I got my license xd
12/30/19, 20:15 - Sara: Oh
12/30/19, 20:15 - Sara: Poor boy
12/30/19, 20:15 - Sara: 🥺
12/30/19, 20:15 - Sara: So is it normal to be like me?
12/30/19, 20:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Absolutely
12/30/19, 20:17 - Sara: I feel like a fool
12/30/19, 20:17 - Sara: But i’m improving some of the somgs i play in the band

12/30/19, 20:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hmm, a familiar looking leg 🤔
12/30/19, 20:19 - Sara: Not mine :P
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: Hahaha
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: It’s Sara’s
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: Funny
12/30/19, 20:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: No? Who dared to touch the drums?
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: Aaah
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: That was me
12/30/19, 20:20 - Sara: But not the leg
12/30/19, 20:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I caught a glimpse of your jeans xd
12/30/19, 20:22 - Sara: But

12/30/19, 23:45 - Sara: 💋
12/30/19, 23:46 - Sara: Kamil, one question
12/30/19, 23:46 - Sara: How do you show people you care about them?
12/30/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Mostly by listening to them, asking how they are, helping as much as I can etc.
12/30/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sometimes I say it, I also prefer physical affection rather then verbal, I suppose
12/30/19, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: So if I was near I would be hugging you all the time 💋
12/30/19, 23:48 - Sara: 🥺🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗💗
12/30/19, 23:48 - Sara: Perfect 💕
12/30/19, 23:48 - Sara: I was overthinking before about that
12/30/19, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, this is the main thing for me, just saying that I care is not very meaningful in my opinion, I prefer to show it
12/30/19, 23:50 - Sara: Sure 💕
12/30/19, 23:50 - Sara: Maybe in the distance it is harder
12/30/19, 23:50 - Sara: Like idk, i like to feel it. But I notice it in that way :)
12/30/19, 23:51 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I can show interest in your life and your problems at any distance
12/30/19, 23:51 - Sara: You do it :)
12/30/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: Virtual hugs are not the same as real ones but well, I'll do what I can
12/30/19, 23:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

12/30/19, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Todo bien ahora?
12/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: Ha estado bien
12/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: Sometimes I bring some insecurities
12/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: Like people don’t love me or are not proud of me
12/30/19, 23:55 - Sara: But I guess that is stupid
12/30/19, 23:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it's best to just talk about it, I think, so no, it's not stupid
12/30/19, 23:57 - Sara: I don’t want yoy to feel that you are not enough or something like that
12/30/19, 23:57 - Sara: I really see your love 💕

12/31/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing, you just like to say it, especially when trying to pronounce polish xd
12/31/19, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: I don't think you know how to say that last word xd
12/31/19, 00:01 - Sara: Say it :)

12/31/19, 00:10 - Sara: Don’t you know who is Kamil?
12/31/19, 00:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: No clue, some loser probably
12/31/19, 00:10 - Sara: Yes, he is a completely loser
12/31/19, 00:10 - Sara: But he is great
12/31/19, 00:10 - Sara: He looks like The Witcher
12/31/19, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: In the books the Witcher is rather ugly
12/31/19, 00:12 - Sara: Is he?
12/31/19, 00:12 - Sara: Oh
12/31/19, 00:12 - Sara: I meant in the series

1/1/20, 03:53 - Sara: Oh
1/1/20, 03:54 - Sara: What exactly?
1/1/20, 03:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Just random stuff, nothing particularly interesting

1/1/20, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Hola, qué tal?
1/1/20, 14:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dime
1/1/20, 14:57 - Sara: Me acabo de levantar 💤
1/1/20, 14:57 - Sara: Llegué a casa a las 8 de la mañana
1/1/20, 14:58 - Sara: Maybe it is silly but it is about kissing with friends xD
1/1/20, 15:00 - Sara: Ayer hacía mucho frío y era -2° :(((
1/1/20, 15:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean?
1/1/20, 15:46 - Sara: Yes... like
1/1/20, 15:47 - Sara: Idk some friends started joking about kisses and one of them have a couple
1/1/20, 15:47 - Sara: So i said “but it is only a kiss (a fast one) between friends”
1/1/20, 15:48 - Sara: And he said “well, that depends on what you talk with you couple”
1/1/20, 15:48 - Sara: And I was wonderig
1/1/20, 16:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: This pretty much sums it up for me
1/1/20, 16:08 - Sara: That is why I asked ^^
1/1/20, 16:11 - Sara: I want to know your opinion
1/1/20, 16:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: What kind of kissing are you even talking about?
1/1/20, 16:21 - Sara: A peck on the lips
1/1/20, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: And why?
1/1/20, 16:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, I can maybe imagine it in a game, like truth or dare, I suppose
1/1/20, 16:22 - Sara: I don’t remember the context
1/1/20, 16:22 - Sara: Not really
1/1/20, 16:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: For me, kissing with friends is probably only on the cheek or something of that sort
1/1/20, 16:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: I was never in a situation where anything more would be appropriate
1/1/20, 16:26 - Sara: Okay
1/1/20, 16:26 - Sara: So i cannot do it?
1/1/20, 16:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's still kind of hard for me to imagine a situation where and why that would happen, tbh
1/1/20, 16:29 - Sara: Just be direct
1/1/20, 16:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I would prefer not
1/1/20, 16:30 - Sara: Ok
1/1/20, 16:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: How are you?
1/1/20, 16:32 - Sara: Fine

1/1/20, 16:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: And what are you doing?

1/1/20, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: What do you mean with this one?
1/1/20, 20:52 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's not like the previous example
1/1/20, 20:52 - Sara: What is the difference between lobię and podoba?
1/1/20, 20:52 - Sara: Genre?
1/1/20, 20:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's just a different verb that means pretty much the same
1/1/20, 20:53 - Sara: Oh! Super ^^

1/1/20, 23:26 - Sara: What do you mean?
1/1/20, 23:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, a day of not working, studying etc.

1/1/20, 23:37 - Sara: This message was deleted
1/1/20, 23:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry I wasn't there for you, I wasn't in a very good mindset today
1/1/20, 23:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will do my best to communicate better

1/1/20, 23:40 - Sara: Sorry
1/1/20, 23:45 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>

1/1/20, 23:46 - Kamil Kuźniak: Do you want to talk?
1/1/20, 23:46 - Sara: You prefer to be alone, it is okay
1/1/20, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not anymore
1/1/20, 23:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: We can talk
1/1/20, 23:48 - Sara: Do not worry
1/1/20, 23:48 - Sara: Idk how to explain it so xd
1/1/20, 23:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you change your mind, feel free, I'm here
1/1/20, 23:50 - Sara: I should be more independent
1/1/20, 23:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you need to talk, I'm here for you
1/1/20, 23:53 - Sara: It is your day
1/1/20, 23:53 - Sara: Do not worry
1/1/20, 23:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm not doing anything anymore today
1/1/20, 23:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: And I feel better now so I want to help you
1/1/20, 23:55 - Sara: What happened to you?
1/1/20, 23:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: I guess new year's, similarly like my birthday doesn't necessarily put me in a very happy mood, also, it is true that I was feeling anxious after our conversation so I just started working and studying
1/1/20, 23:58 - Sara: Sorry
1/1/20, 23:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now tell me what happened to you
1/1/20, 23:59 - Sara: Just sad, do not worry
1/1/20, 23:59 - Sara: You have your shit
1/2/20, 00:00 - Sara: I don’t help
1/2/20, 00:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: Tell me, I want to support you
1/2/20, 00:00 - Sara: Just felt alone
1/2/20, 00:00 - Sara: And feeling bad for the topic
1/2/20, 00:00 - Sara: I wanted to talk more about it
1/2/20, 00:01 - Sara: But well, fine
1/2/20, 00:01 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry
1/2/20, 00:01 - Sara: No problem
1/2/20, 00:02 - Sara: Again
1/2/20, 00:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nothing wrong about asking for help or talking about problems
1/2/20, 00:03 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry that my bad day coincided with yours and I wasn't there for you
1/2/20, 00:03 - Sara: I say the same
1/2/20, 00:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:05 - Sara: This message was deleted
1/2/20, 00:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: What was that?
1/2/20, 00:06 - Sara: A sticker
1/2/20, 00:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Something about a razor in a pocket?
1/2/20, 00:06 - Sara: But i want to find one sticker that defines me now with what you sent
1/2/20, 00:06 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:06 - Sara: There it is 😌
1/2/20, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: That one seemed a bit aggressive, a bit more than forehead kisses
1/2/20, 00:07 - Kamil Kuźniak: Which will be delivered in less than 4 weeks, btw
1/2/20, 00:07 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:07 - Sara: Damn
1/2/20, 00:07 - Sara: It is about stabbing someone
1/2/20, 00:07 - Sara: Nice
1/2/20, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Misclick, I hope?
1/2/20, 00:08 - Sara: Not now
1/2/20, 00:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: Or you wish to stab me?
1/2/20, 00:08 - Sara: I wanted to read it
1/2/20, 00:08 - Sara: I wanted to find this one
1/2/20, 00:08 - Sara: Not yet
1/2/20, 00:08 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:10 - Sara: I think these days I missed your support I guess
1/2/20, 00:11 - Sara: But I have to live without that
1/2/20, 00:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:12 - Sara: Do not worry
1/2/20, 00:12 - Sara: .
1/2/20, 00:13 - Sara: I didn’t feel loved I guess
1/2/20, 00:13 - Sara: But that is my mistake
1/2/20, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, more like mine, I wasn't expressing it enough
1/2/20, 00:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm sorry amor 💋
1/2/20, 00:13 - Sara: No way
1/2/20, 00:14 - Sara: That is your way
1/2/20, 00:14 - Sara: I have to get used to that
1/2/20, 00:14 - Sara: Don’t apologize please
1/2/20, 00:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:15 - Sara: For me it is fine
1/2/20, 00:15 - Sara: I guess sometimes I have problems in expressing what I feel
1/2/20, 00:15 - Sara: Or i think
1/2/20, 00:16 - Sara: Now I have been the reason you maintained distance from me
1/2/20, 00:16 - Sara: So no more shit on you
1/2/20, 00:17 - Sara: Some things i want to express are rather useless?
1/2/20, 00:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel like you cannot talk to me about your problems then I failed you
1/2/20, 00:17 - Sara: No man
1/2/20, 00:17 - Sara: .
1/2/20, 00:18 - Sara: You had your bad day
1/2/20, 00:21 - Sara: I wanted to see you but i’m crying a lot xdddd
1/2/20, 00:21 - Sara: Also need to go to the bathroom xd
1/2/20, 00:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:23 - Sara: I know
1/2/20, 00:23 - Sara: But idk what to say
1/2/20, 00:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: This?
1/2/20, 00:23 - Sara: I think I said everything I wanted to say
1/2/20, 00:24 - Sara: I’m just sad for no reason
1/2/20, 00:24 - Sara: Like if I had a reason, i’d not mind
1/2/20, 00:24 - Sara: But because there isn’t any, i don’t want to waste your time
1/2/20, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: You said you didn't feel loved, I treat this seriously, can you tell me how can I do better?
1/2/20, 00:25 - Sara: Just be yourself
1/2/20, 00:25 - Kamil Kuźniak: It isn't about accepting that I am like this, I can change that and I am willing
1/2/20, 00:26 - Kamil Kuźniak: Like, saying I love you more is not going to kill me or change who I am
1/2/20, 00:26 - Sara: Again
1/2/20, 00:26 - Sara: ^^
1/2/20, 00:27 - Kamil Kuźniak: But maybe you have something in mind that you would like me to do more often?
1/2/20, 00:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also, bardzo cię kocham, mam nadzieję że to wiesz ❤️
1/2/20, 00:28 - Sara: It is fine 💋
1/2/20, 00:28 - Sara: Thanks
1/2/20, 00:29 - Sara: But say it when you mean it, not when i’m sad
1/2/20, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I always mean it
1/2/20, 00:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: I told you that I'm not going to tell you things that I don't actually believe
1/2/20, 00:29 - Sara: Don’t feel bad about this, okay?
1/2/20, 00:29 - Sara: I appreciate it :)
1/2/20, 00:30 - Sara: I’m just sad, i’m not like this
1/2/20, 00:31 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, if you don't feel like talking about this than maybe tell me about your plans for tomorrow?
1/2/20, 00:32 - Sara: Mainly studying and meeting Christian
1/2/20, 00:32 - Sara: You?
1/2/20, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Probably the same as today, I want to finish the project as soon as possible
1/2/20, 00:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Also I'll continue looking for places to visit in Cracow and Warsaw
1/2/20, 00:32 - Sara: Good luck with it 💕
1/2/20, 00:33 - Sara: Do you need help?
1/2/20, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: As I said before, if you have something in mind that you want to visit, tell me
1/2/20, 00:33 - Kamil Kuźniak: If you feel like you can help, but it's not necessary
1/2/20, 00:34 - Sara: Okay to both❤
1/2/20, 00:34 - Sara: Thanks 💗
1/2/20, 00:34 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'll try to assemble a list and we can discuss it
1/2/20, 00:34 - Sara: Great 😊
1/2/20, 00:35 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:35 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:36 - Sara: Yay 😁
1/2/20, 00:36 - Sara: Yesterday i almost froze to death
1/2/20, 00:36 - Kamil Kuźniak: That cold?
1/2/20, 00:36 - Sara: Yes
1/2/20, 00:36 - Sara: It was really foggy and that did not help at all
1/2/20, 00:36 - Sara: It was like -2°
1/2/20, 00:37 - Sara: Even more
1/2/20, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: My brother also has one so I can borrow his and we can both go around in these
1/2/20, 00:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Quite cold, it's similar here, but during the whole day xd
1/2/20, 00:37 - Sara: Pffff 💀
1/2/20, 00:37 - Sara: Please 😁
1/2/20, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: But then you should practice russian
1/2/20, 00:38 - Sara: Russian is the new Polish
1/2/20, 00:38 - Sara: Fair enough
1/2/20, 00:38 - Kamil Kuźniak: Similar difficulty, I think, but also a different alphabet
1/2/20, 00:39 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Google translate intensifies*
1/2/20, 00:40 - Sara: Hahahaha
1/2/20, 00:40 - Sara: And better
1/2/20, 00:40 - Kamil Kuźniak: I've heard an opinion that Portuguese sound like Russian
1/2/20, 00:41 - Kamil Kuźniak: So maybe that would be easier for you xd
1/2/20, 00:41 - Sara: Absolutely not xDd
1/2/20, 00:42 - Kamil Kuźniak: Buuu, you're not putting any effort into our russian cosplay
1/2/20, 00:42 - Sara: Xdd
1/2/20, 00:42 - Sara: I’ll
1/2/20, 00:44 - Sara: Do not worry
1/2/20, 00:44 - Kamil Kuźniak: About your Russian?
1/2/20, 00:46 - Sara: Yes
1/2/20, 00:46 - Sara: I’ll try to be the best russian ever
1/2/20, 00:47 - Sara: I’ll try to be the best couple ever
1/2/20, 00:47 - Sara: Although it is hard
1/2/20, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 00:47 - Kamil Kuźniak: That I have no doubt about ❤❤❤
1/2/20, 00:48 - Sara: Epic
1/2/20, 00:48 - Sara: I’m shitty
1/2/20, 00:48 - Sara: I could express my emotions ever
1/2/20, 00:48 - Sara: Better*
1/2/20, 00:49 - Kamil Kuźniak: So could I, it's a learning process
1/2/20, 00:49 - Sara: Sure
1/2/20, 00:49 - Sara: 2020 goal
1/2/20, 00:49 - Sara: Sorry for everything
1/2/20, 00:50 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's okay babe 😘
1/2/20, 00:50 - Sara: Thanks
1/2/20, 00:50 - Sara: I don’t know what is wrong with tme
1/2/20, 00:50 - Sara: I guess i stated feeling anxioua abour being limited even in the smallest thing
1/2/20, 00:51 - Sara: And then that i couldn’t talk with you about that
1/2/20, 00:51 - Sara: I notices also that you were not okay so that made me overthink
1/2/20, 00:51 - Sara: Also what i have been accumulating about not feeling appreciate it or loved somehow
1/2/20, 00:52 - Sara: I guess I have to deal with that on my own
1/2/20, 00:52 - Sara: Maybe it is only in my head
1/2/20, 00:53 - Kamil Kuźniak: Sorry for everything too, I understand and I'll do my best to be better
1/2/20, 00:53 - Sara: Or at least i think about that not to make you feel bad
1/2/20, 00:53 - Sara: What have you done?
1/2/20, 00:53 - Sara: Nothing
1/2/20, 00:53 - Sara: I have to get used to it
1/2/20, 00:54 - Kamil Kuźniak: Can you come to Poland now? Seriously
1/2/20, 00:54 - Sara: Why?
1/2/20, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why not?
1/2/20, 00:55 - Sara: Like I have felt that my opinion does not count in our “agreement”, you know? So that is why i feel like it is useless
1/2/20, 00:55 - Kamil Kuźniak: You look like you need a hug, I need a hug, it makes pefect sense
1/2/20, 00:55 - Sara: 💕
1/2/20, 00:55 - Sara: **taking plane**
1/2/20, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: I pretty much told you before to do what you feel is right, I said that I don't want to give you rules
1/2/20, 00:56 - Kamil Kuźniak: you asked me today for my opinion and you got it
1/2/20, 00:57 - Kamil Kuźniak: What you do with it is up to you
1/2/20, 00:58 - Sara: That really sounds threatening, although you told me the opposite
1/2/20, 00:58 - Sara: I’m afraid of fuck it up
1/2/20, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: sorry, I mean that if you really want, I will give you my opinion on these topics but I won't tell you what to do
1/2/20, 00:59 - Kamil Kuźniak: That is all
1/2/20, 01:00 - Sara: Telling you or not what i do?
1/2/20, 01:00 - Kamil Kuźniak: With all this, everytime that topic comes up I get anxious and I start thinking that you will break up with me again
1/2/20, 01:00 - Sara: I’m afraid that you don’t trust me :(
1/2/20, 01:00 - Sara: Why?
1/2/20, 01:01 - Sara: So you say this because you don’t want to break up with me or because you really think that?
1/2/20, 01:02 - Kamil Kuźniak: I really think that and I'm not going to hide what I think even though it makes me afraid
1/2/20, 01:02 - Sara: You shouldn’t
1/2/20, 01:02 - Sara: Trust me
1/2/20, 01:03 - Sara: Sorry 😖
1/2/20, 01:04 - Sara: I want you to feel you safe
1/2/20, 01:04 - Kamil Kuźniak: I will probably need some time for that
1/2/20, 01:05 - Sara: Sorry
1/2/20, 01:05 - Kamil Kuźniak: Now it's all still relatively fresh and feels rather fragile
1/2/20, 01:05 - Sara: Fair enough
1/2/20, 01:05 - Sara: So I failed as well
1/2/20, 01:06 - Kamil Kuźniak: Maybe yes, maybe no, it's past so no point thinking about it too much
1/2/20, 01:06 - Sara: Okay
1/2/20, 01:07 - Sara: Sorry
1/2/20, 01:08 - Kamil Kuźniak: It's ok, don't worry
1/2/20, 01:08 - Sara: I will try to change
1/2/20, 01:08 - Sara: And to change this
1/2/20, 01:09 - Sara: Probably I should go to sleep
1/2/20, 01:10 - Sara: It is not worth overthinking
1/2/20, 01:10 - Kamil Kuźniak: Me too, I'll do my best so that you don't feel alone again and so that you always feel loved
1/2/20, 01:10 - Sara: I say the same
1/2/20, 01:10 - Sara: I want you to feel secure
1/2/20, 01:11 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thanks ❤️
1/2/20, 01:11 - Sara: Thanks to you as well
1/2/20, 01:11 - Sara: Good night Kamil
1/2/20, 01:11 - Sara: And thanks for understanding me
1/2/20, 01:11 - Sara: Or kind of xd
1/2/20, 01:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Dobranoc 😘
1/2/20, 01:12 - Sara: Buenas noches
1/2/20, 01:12 - Sara: Wait
1/2/20, 01:13 - Sara: So no talking abou this again?
1/2/20, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, it is not pleasant but at the same time hiding it is not any better
1/2/20, 01:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: So if something comes to your mind, we can talk
1/2/20, 01:14 - Sara: But...
1/2/20, 01:14 - Sara: I don’t want this
1/2/20, 01:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I guess, but at the same time hiding things is not very good for trust and feeling secure
1/2/20, 01:15 - Sara: I’m not evil
1/2/20, 01:16 - Sara: I swear
1/2/20, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: I know, I didn't mean that
1/2/20, 01:16 - Sara: I don’t want to hurt you
1/2/20, 01:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Thanks, really
1/2/20, 01:17 - Sara: Why?
1/2/20, 01:17 - Sara: I do the opposite
1/2/20, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: You genuinely seem to care about me, not many people do
1/2/20, 01:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: So thank you
1/2/20, 01:18 - Sara: Of course i do
1/2/20, 01:18 - Sara: I love you
1/2/20, 01:18 - Sara: Don’t need to say it
1/2/20, 01:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Love you 3000 💓
1/2/20, 01:19 - Sara: I hope you remember it
1/2/20, 01:19 - Sara: <Media omitted>

1/2/20, 01:27 - Sara: For making you feel less, not enough, no worth, insecure
1/2/20, 01:27 - Sara: You don’t deserve that
1/2/20, 01:28 - Sara: I apologize
1/2/20, 01:28 - Sara: I’ll change
1/2/20, 01:30 - Kamil Kuźniak: Te quiero mucho ❤️

1/2/20, 13:11 - Sara: Less than 0,5kg but I feel my body is... harder? XD
1/2/20, 13:11 - Sara: And with all the dinners... it is not bad
1/2/20, 13:11 - Sara: Jak się masz?
1/2/20, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: *Harder* 🌝
1/2/20, 13:12 - Sara: 🌝
1/2/20, 13:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: It hasn't been long since you started working on it so I think it's a very good result

1/2/20, 13:16 - Sara: Better
1/2/20, 13:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: It was an experiment so I had to look accordingly xd
1/2/20, 13:21 - Sara: And it worked right?
1/2/20, 13:22 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, sort of but we had to abort the experiment early xd
1/2/20, 13:30 - Sara: Hahahaha
1/2/20, 13:30 - Sara: QUE ME CAGO
1/2/20, 13:30 - Sara: Well, i want to see you in my situation xD
1/2/20, 13:30 - Sara: But at least I know that was normal
1/2/20, 13:32 - Kamil Kuźniak: Ummm, well, it was your own choice, not my fault that you decided to let life butt fuck you xddd
1/2/20, 13:35 - Sara: Of course
1/2/20, 13:36 - Sara: Xdddddd
1/2/20, 13:36 - Sara: How is it going?
1/2/20, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: I'm ok, slowly starting to do something useful
1/2/20, 13:37 - Kamil Kuźniak: Considering this I really don't understand why you're still interested xd
1/2/20, 13:41 - Sara: HAHAHAHAHA
1/2/20, 13:42 - Sara: Shouldn’t I?

1/2/20, 14:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 14:11 - Sara: <Media omitted>
1/2/20, 14:12 - Kamil Kuźniak: Cómo estás?

1/2/20, 14:12 - Sara: Dobrzę

1/2/20, 14:12 - Sara: I’m watchig a video about the best positions for anal sex xd
1/2/20, 14:13 - Kamil Kuźniak: In polish you would say 'A ty?'
1/2/20, 14:13 - Sara: Why? I thought “i” was “and”
1/2/20, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: So it's definitely still included in plans xd
1/2/20, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Because polish xd
1/2/20, 14:14 - Sara: Why not? XD
1/2/20, 14:14 - Sara: Polish ugh
1/2/20, 14:14 - Kamil Kuźniak: Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining xd
1/2/20, 14:15 - Sara: Sure? I thought so
1/2/20, 14:15 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why?
1/2/20, 14:15 - Sara: .
1/2/20, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't understand it from your perspective, from mine it is fine xd
1/2/20, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: But if you like it, than that's enough
1/2/20, 14:16 - Kamil Kuźniak: Then*
1/2/20, 14:16 - Sara: Sorry, though you disliked it since then
1/2/20, 14:17 - Kamil Kuźniak: Nop, I didn't have any issues, I was just a bit surprised after how it went that you still want it
1/2/20, 14:18 - Sara: If I har to judge everything according to first intentions and tries...
1/2/20, 14:18 - Sara: I’m here to explore, not bad I guess
1/2/20, 14:18 - Kamil Kuźniak: Fair enough
1/2/20, 14:19 - Sara: Sorry 😂
1/2/20, 14:19 - Kamil Kuźniak: Why sorry?
1/2/20, 14:19 - Sara: Idk, if I caused a misunderstanding
1/2/20, 14:19 - Sara: I feel better if I apologize
1/2/20, 14:19 - Sara: Like many times
1/2/20, 14:19 - Sara: I don’t want to hurt you
1/2/20, 14:20 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, ok, but this wasn't really any problem
1/2/20, 14:20 - Sara: Sure
1/2/20, 14:20 - Sara: Would you consider yoursef delicate?
1/2/20, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Not really, I guess
1/2/20, 14:21 - Kamil Kuźniak: Although it probably depends on the specific topic
1/2/20, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: I think I mentioned that sometimes you overthink things and conversations that I didn't even pay much attention to
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: Seems reasonably
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: Yes, true
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: I’m afraid of you having a different perspective about me
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: To let you down I guess
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: I don’t want to have problema
1/2/20, 14:23 - Sara: Problems*
1/2/20, 14:23 - Kamil Kuźniak: But that's fine, it's a learning process
1/2/20, 14:24 - Kamil Kuźniak: For both of us
1/2/20, 14:24 - Sara: Yes
1/2/20, 14:24 - Sara: I hope not be worried all the time

1/2/20, 14:26 - Sara: I want to be a good person
1/2/20, 14:26 - Sara: And a good couple
1/2/20, 14:26 - Sara: Before I went to sleep I thought I have been a bad couple with you and with Guada
1/2/20, 14:26 - Sara: So it is a inner fear of failing
1/2/20, 14:26 - Sara: Once again
1/2/20, 14:28 - Kamil Kuźniak: Well, I don't really know how it was between you and Guada but it seems like it wasn't your fault, or at least it wasn't only your fault
1/2/20, 14:29 - Kamil Kuźniak: With me, Idk, I don't even know what is a good couple
1/2/20, 14:29 - Sara: Kamil
1/2/20, 14:29 - Sara: Did you send me something?
1/2/20, 14:29 - Sara: Me neither
